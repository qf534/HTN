    "Art is a diverse range of human activity and its resulting product that involves creative or imaginative talent generally expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas. There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts. Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts. The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics. The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art. Overview In the perspective of the history of art, artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early prehistoric art to contemporary art; however, some theorists think that the typical concept of \"artistic works\" does not fit well outside modern Western societies.",
    "English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology. Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art. Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted. With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.",
    "The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals. The more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century. Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer works of art. Within this latter sense, the word art may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (art as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks (art as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses.",
    "For some scholars, such as Kant, the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression. Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent. The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as \"one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture\". Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation.",
    "Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator. The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Kant, and was developed in the early 20th century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation. George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as \"the art world\" has conferred \"the status of candidate for appreciation\". Larry Shiner has described fine art as \"not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.\" Art may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as \"a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science\". History A shell engraved by Homo erectus was determined to be between 430,000 and 540,000 years old.",
    "A series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave. Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years. The oldest piece of art found in Europe is the Riesenhirschknochen der Einhornhöhle, dating back 51,000 years and made by Neanderthals. Sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. The first undisputed sculptures and similar art pieces, like the Venus of Hohle Fels, are the numerous objects found at the Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura UNESCO World Heritage Site, where the oldest non-stationary works of human art yet discovered were found, in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines, in addition to the oldest musical instruments unearthed so far, with the artifacts dating between 43,000 and 35,000 BC, so being the first centre of human art. Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as Inca, Maya, and Olmec.",
    "Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. In Byzantine and Medieval art of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe. Renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space. In the east, Islamic art's rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns, calligraphy, and architecture. Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too.",
    "China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning terracotta army of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, Tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but Ming dynasty paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. Woodblock printing became important in Japan after the 17th century. The western Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as Blake's portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or David's propagandistic paintings. This led to Romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of Goethe. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as academic art, Symbolism, impressionism and fauvism among others.",
    "Thus the parameters of Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence. Modernism, the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. Theodor W. Adorno said in 1970, \"It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist.\" Relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism, where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony.",
    "In The Origin of the Work of Art, Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher and seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which \"that which is\" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed. Historically, art and artistic skills and ideas have often been spread through trade. An example of this is the Silk Road, where Hellenistic, Iranian, Indian and Chinese influences could mix. Greco Buddhist art is one of the most vivid examples of this interaction. The meeting of different cultures and worldviews also influenced artistic creation. An example of this is the multicultural port metropolis of Trieste at the beginning of the 20th century, where James Joyce met writers from Central Europe and the artistic development of New York City as a cultural melting pot. Forms, genres, media, and styles The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media, genre, styles, and form.",
    "It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., figurae), such as color, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, and value. Form may also include Design principles, such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and rhythm. In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context. Extreme Formalism is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form. Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content—i.e., denotations and connotations—while others prefer terms like meaning and significance. Extreme Intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded. It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented, and the content as the artist's experience of that subject. For example, the composition of Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne is partly borrowed from the Statue of Zeus at Olympia.",
    "God beyond time and space\". Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is \"socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise\". Finally, the developing theory of post-structuralism studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work. The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. Art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art. Skill and craft Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium. Art can also refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations. There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.",
    "Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for Leonardo da Vinci, art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. Rembrandt's work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of John Singer Sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, Pablo Picasso, was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled. A common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp's Fountain is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects (\"ready-made\") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills. Tracey Emin's My Bed, or Damien Hirst's The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media.",
    "Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands-on works of art. Purpose Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of art is \"vague\", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss). Non-motivated functions The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility. Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm.",
    "Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. – Aristotle Experience of the mysterious. Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein Expression of the imagination. Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words.",
    "Immanuel Kant Ritualistic and symbolic functions. In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. – Silva Tomaskova Motivated functions Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or used as a form of communication. Communication. Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose.",
    "Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen Art as entertainment. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of motion pictures and video games. The Avant-Garde. Art for political change. One of the defining functions of early 20th-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others—are collectively referred to as the avant-garde arts.By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism) Art as a \"free zone\", removed from the action of the social censure.",
    "Art for social inquiry, subversion or anarchy. While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be used to criticize some aspect of society. Graffiti art and other types of street art are graphics and images that are spray-painted or stencilled on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism). Art for social causes. Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of autism, cancer, human trafficking, and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation, human rights in Darfur, murdered and missing Aboriginal women, elder abuse, and pollution. Trashion, using trash to make fashion, practiced by artists such as Marina DeBris is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution. Art for psychological and healing purposes.",
    "The Diagnostic Drawing Series, for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy. Art for propaganda, or commercialism. Art is often used as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object. Art as a fitness indicator. It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the peacock's tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also Fisherian runaway and handicap principle).",
    "The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game. Steps Art can be divided into any number of steps one can make an argument for. This section divides the creative process into broad three steps, but there is no consensus on an exact number. Preparation In the first step, the artist envisions the art in their mind. By imagining what their art would look like, the artist begins the process of bringing the art into existence. Preparation of art may involve approaching and researching the subject matter. Artistic inspiration is one of the main drivers of art, and may be considered to stem from instinct, impressions, and feelings. Creation In the second step, the artist executes the creation of their work. The creation of a piece can be affected by factors such as the artist's mood, surroundings, and mental state. For example, The Black Paintings by Francisco de Goya, created in the elder years of his life, are thought to be so bleak because he was in isolation and because of his experience with war. He painted them directly on the walls of his apartment in Spain, and most likely never discussed them with anyone. The Beatles stated drugs such as LSD and cannabis influenced some of their greatest hits, such as Revolver. Trial and error are considered an integral part of the creation process.",
    "In one study, over half of visual arts students agreed that reflection is an essential step of the art process. According to education journals, the reflection of art is considered an essential part of the experience. However an important aspect of art is that others may view and appreciate it as well. While many focus on whether those viewing/listening/etc. believe the art to be good/successful or not, art has profound value beyond its commercial success as a provider of information and health in society. Art enjoyment can bring about a wide spectrum of emotion due to beauty. Some art is meant to be practical, with its analysis studious, meant to stimulate discourse. Public access Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society. Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood.",
    "Reproductive methods such as moulds made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality Ancient Roman pottery and Greek Tanagra figurines to a very wide market. Cylinder seals were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the Ancient Near East. Once coins were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society. Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when printmaking began with small woodcuts, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations. Popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries. In 1661, the city of Basel, in Switzerland, opened the first public museum of art in the world, the Kunstmuseum Basel. Today, its collection is distinguished by an impressively wide historic span, from the early 15th century up to the immediate present. Its various areas of emphasis give it international standing as one of the most significant museums of its kind. These encompass: paintings and drawings by artists active in the Upper Rhine region between 1400 and 1600, and on the art of the 19th to 21st centuries.",
    "Egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests. Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the Palace of Versailles, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside. Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the Orleans Collection mostly housed in a wing of the Palais Royal in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible.",
    "The building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. The opening of the Musée du Louvre during the French Revolution (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established. Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. However, museums do not only provide availability to art, but do also influence the way art is being perceived by the audience, as studies found. Thus, the museum itself is not only a blunt stage for the presentation of art, but plays an active and vital role in the overall perception of art in modern society. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for example, was created by John Taylor Johnston, a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.",
    "There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is \"necessary to present something more than mere objects\" said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as performance art, video art, and conceptual art. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was an idea, it could not be bought and sold. \"Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object.\" In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works, invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces.",
    "The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. \"With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors.\" Controversies Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. Iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. Aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of Islamic art, where depictions of Muhammad remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics, though often much less so by a wider public. The iconographic content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the Swoon of the Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus.",
    "The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of Romanticism, and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. Édouard Manet's Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world. John Singer Sargent's Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madam X) (1884), caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's reputation. The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century.",
    "Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts. Theory Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries. This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art. The aesthetic theorist John Ruskin, who championed what he saw as the naturalism of J. M. W. Turner, saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature. The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century.",
    "Arrival of Modernism The arrival of Modernism in the late 19th century led to a radical break in the conception of the function of art, and then again in the late 20th century with the advent of postmodernism. Clement Greenberg's 1960 article \"Modernist Painting\" defines modern art as \"the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself\". Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting: Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly. After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as Michael Fried, T. J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock among others.",
    "Pop artists like Andy Warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the art world. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond high art to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography. Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind-everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction. There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. In The Invention of Art: A Cultural History, Larry Shiner examines the construction of the modern system of the arts, i.e. fine art. He finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity; for example, Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art, but techne. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music, but also cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and farming, etc."

    "Art encompasses a wide array of human activities and their resultant products, characterized by creative or imaginative talent that often reflects technical proficiency, beauty, emotional depth, or conceptual ideas. The definition of art remains a subject of debate, with interpretations varying significantly across different historical periods and cultures.\n\nIn the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. A broader definition of the arts also includes performing arts such as theatre and dance, as well as literature, music, film, and interactive media. Historically, until the 17th century, the term \"art\" referred to any skill or mastery and was not distinctly separated from crafts or sciences. However, in modern usage, particularly post-17th century, art has come to emphasize aesthetic considerations, leading to a distinction between the fine arts and other acquired skills, such as decorative or applied arts.\n\nThe nature of art, along with related concepts such as creativity and interpretation, is examined within the philosophical discipline known as aesthetics. The resulting artworks are further analyzed in the professional fields of art criticism and art history.\n\n\nFrom a historical perspective, artistic works have existed for nearly as long as humanity itself, ranging from early prehistoric art to contemporary expressions. However, some theorists argue that the conventional understanding of \"artistic works\" may not be fully applicable outside of modern Western societies.",
    "China has a rich artistic heritage that includes various forms such as jade carving, bronzework, pottery—most notably the terracotta army of Emperor Qin—poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. The styles of Chinese art have evolved significantly over different historical periods, with each era commonly identified by the ruling dynasty. For instance, paintings from the Tang dynasty are characterized by their monochromatic and minimalist approach, focusing on idealized landscapes. In contrast, Ming dynasty paintings are known for their vibrant colors and intricate compositions that often convey narratives through their settings.\n\nSimilarly, Japan has its own artistic traditions, which are also named after imperial dynasties. The interplay between calligraphy and painting is particularly notable in Japanese art. Following the 17th century, woodblock printing gained prominence in Japan, contributing to the dissemination of artistic works.\n\nIn the Western context, the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century brought forth artistic representations that emphasized the physical and rational aspects of the universe. This period also witnessed politically charged artworks, such as William Blake's depiction of Isaac Newton as a divine geometer and Jacques-Louis David's propagandistic paintings. The subsequent Romantic movement emerged as a reaction against Enlightenment ideals, prioritizing emotional expression and individuality, as exemplified in the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nThe late 19th century marked the rise of various artistic movements, including academic art, Symbolism, Impressionism, and Fauvism, each contributing to the diverse landscape of art during this period.",
    "Leo Tolstoy defined art as a means of indirect communication between individuals. Philosophers Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood further developed the idealist perspective, positing that art serves to express emotions, suggesting that the essence of a work of art resides primarily in the mind of its creator.\n\nThe theory of art as form has its origins in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and was expanded in the early 20th century by theorists such as Roger Fry and Clive Bell. More contemporary thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as a medium through which communities cultivate self-expression and interpretation.\n\nGeorge Dickie proposed an institutional theory of art, defining a work of art as any artifact designated as a \"candidate for appreciation\" by qualified individuals acting on behalf of the social institution commonly known as \"the art world.\" Larry Shiner characterized fine art as a construct, stating that it is \"not an essence or a fate but something we have made,\" and noted that the concept of art as it is commonly understood today is a relatively recent European invention, emerging within the last two hundred years.\n\nArt can be characterized by various qualities, including mimesis (the representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, and the communication of emotion. During the Romantic period, art began to be regarded as a unique faculty of the human mind, akin to religion and science.\n\n\nThe history of art dates back to prehistoric times, with a shell engraved by Homo erectus estimated to be between 430,000 and 540,000 years old, marking one of the earliest known instances of artistic expression.",
    "The term \"art\" has given rise to several English words, including \"artifact,\" \"artificial,\" \"artifice,\" \"medical arts,\" and \"military arts.\" Additionally, there are numerous colloquial uses of the word, all of which relate to its etymological roots.\n\nThroughout history, prominent philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and Immanuel Kant have explored the concept of art. In various dialogues, Plato addresses fundamental questions about art. For instance, in the \"Phaedrus,\" Socrates posits that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not a product of rational thought. He expresses a favorable view of this divine inspiration, which he associates with forms of \"divine madness,\" including drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming. However, in \"The Republic,\" he advocates for the prohibition of Homer's poetic works and laughter, indicating a complex relationship with artistic expression.\n\nIn the dialogue \"Ion,\" Socrates does not reveal the disapproval of Homer that he later articulates in \"The Republic.\" Instead, \"Ion\" suggests that Homer's \"Iliad\" served a role in ancient Greek society similar to that of the Bible in contemporary Christian culture: as a divinely inspired literary work that offers moral guidance, contingent upon proper interpretation.\n\nAristotle further contributed to the discourse on art by categorizing various forms of literary and musical expression. He regarded epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, Dithyrambic poetry, and music as mimetic or imitative arts, each distinguished by its medium, subject matter, and method of imitation.",
    "A series of tiny, drilled snail shells, estimated to be around 75,000 years old, were discovered in a South African cave. Additionally, containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found, dating back as far as 100,000 years. \n\nThe oldest known piece of art in Europe is the Riesenhirschknochen from the Einhornhöhle, which dates back approximately 51,000 years and is attributed to Neanderthals. Various forms of art, including sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings, and petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic period, have been dated to around 40,000 years ago. However, the precise meanings of these artworks remain a subject of debate, as little is known about the cultures that created them.\n\nThe first undisputed sculptures and similar art pieces, such as the Venus of Hohle Fels, were discovered at the Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura UNESCO World Heritage Site. This site is significant for containing the oldest known non-stationary works of human art, including carved animal and humanoid figurines, as well as the earliest musical instruments discovered to date. These artifacts date between 43,000 and 35,000 BCE, marking this region as a pivotal center of early human artistic expression.\n\nMany foundational traditions in art can be traced back to the works of several ancient civilizations, including Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as the Inca, Maya, and Olmec cultures.",
    "The extensive duration and influence of ancient civilizations have resulted in the preservation of numerous artworks and the transmission of their artistic practices to subsequent cultures. Notably, these civilizations have provided some of the earliest records detailing the methods employed by artists.\n\nDuring the period of Greek art, there was a profound appreciation for the human form, characterized by the development of techniques that accurately represented musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomical proportions. This era laid the groundwork for future artistic endeavors.\n\nIn contrast, Byzantine and Medieval art of the Western Middle Ages predominantly focused on biblical and religious themes. Artists employed styles that aimed to convey the divine, often utilizing gold backgrounds in paintings and glass in mosaics and windows. These works typically presented figures in idealized, flat forms. Despite this, a classical realist tradition persisted in smaller Byzantine artworks, and realism gradually gained prominence in the art of Catholic Europe.\n\nThe Renaissance marked a significant shift towards the realistic depiction of the material world and humanity's place within it. Artists emphasized the corporeality of the human body and developed systematic methods of graphical perspective, allowing for the representation of depth in a three-dimensional space.\n\nIn the East, Islamic art distinguished itself through a rejection of iconography, leading to a focus on geometric patterns, calligraphy, and architectural forms. Further east, religious themes continued to dominate artistic styles and expressions, reflecting the cultural and spiritual values of the time.",
    "Art encompasses a wide range of creative expressions and is categorized into various forms, each differing in their object of imitation and manner of representation. For instance, comedy is characterized as a dramatic imitation of individuals who are perceived to be worse than average, while tragedy portrays individuals who are slightly better than average. \n\nThe distinctions among these forms also extend to their methods of imitation, which can include narrative or character-driven approaches, as well as variations in change and dramatic elements. Aristotle posited that imitation is an inherent aspect of human nature and serves as a distinguishing advantage over other animals.\n\nThe contemporary understanding of the term \"art,\" particularly as it relates to creative or fine art, began to take shape in the early 17th century. Fine art is often defined as a skill utilized to express the artist's creativity, engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or encourage contemplation of more refined artistic works.\n\nIn this context, \"art\" can refer to several interconnected concepts: \n1. The study of a creative skill,\n2. The process of employing that creative skill,\n3. The products resulting from the creative skill, and \n4. The audience's experience of the creative skill.\n\nThe creative arts, as a discipline, encompass a variety of fields that produce artworks (art as objects) driven by personal expression (art as activity) and convey messages, moods, or symbolism for interpretation by the audience (art as experience). Ultimately, art serves to stimulate an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through sensory engagement.",
    "In \"The Origin of the Work of Art,\" Martin Heidegger, a prominent German philosopher, explores the essence of art through the concepts of being and truth. Heidegger posits that art serves not only as a medium for expressing the truth inherent in a culture but also as a means of creating that truth. He suggests that art provides a foundation from which \"that which is\" can be revealed. \n\nWorks of art transcend mere representation; they actively shape a community's shared understanding. Each new artwork introduced into a culture alters the collective meaning of existence. Historically, the dissemination of artistic skills and ideas has often occurred through trade routes. A notable example is the Silk Road, where Hellenistic, Iranian, Indian, and Chinese influences converged. Greco-Buddhist art exemplifies this cultural interaction.\n\nThe intersection of diverse cultures and worldviews has significantly influenced artistic creation. For instance, the multicultural port city of Trieste in the early 20th century served as a meeting point for writers, including James Joyce, from Central Europe. Similarly, New York City has been recognized as a cultural melting pot that fostered artistic development.\n\nThe creative arts are commonly categorized into specific forms, genres, media, and styles, often based on perceptually distinguishable characteristics. This classification aids in the understanding and appreciation of the vast array of artistic expressions.",
    "Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, and Surrealism are art movements that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the parameters defining these movements cannot be rigidly maintained beyond their inception. The increasing global interactions during this period facilitated the cross-pollination of artistic ideas and practices, leading to significant influences from various cultures on Western art.\n\nOne notable influence was that of Japanese woodblock prints, which, while themselves shaped by Western Renaissance techniques, had a profound impact on Impressionism and its subsequent developments. Similarly, African sculptures inspired artists such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, contributing to the evolution of modern art.\n\nConversely, Western art also exerted considerable influence on Eastern artistic traditions during the 19th and 20th centuries. Concepts such as Communism and Postmodernism, originating in the West, had a significant impact on Eastern art practices.\n\nModernism, characterized by an idealistic pursuit of truth, began to wane in the latter half of the 20th century as artists and theorists recognized the complexities and challenges associated with this quest. Theodor W. Adorno articulated this shift in 1970, stating, \"It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist.\"\n\nThis acknowledgment of relativism as an inherent aspect of contemporary discourse led to the emergence of contemporary art and postmodern criticism. In this context, cultures and historical narratives are viewed as evolving forms, appreciated through a lens of skepticism and irony.",
    "The concept of \"God beyond time and space\" often intersects with various philosophical discussions regarding the nature of art and its interpretation. Philosophers frequently critique extreme intentionalism, which posits that an artist's intent is paramount in understanding a work of art. This perspective is often deemed limiting, as art can embody multiple, ambiguous meanings, and the artist's intentions may be unknowable or irrelevant. Critics argue that such a restrictive interpretation is \"socially unhealthy, philosophically unrealistic, and politically unwise.\"\n\nThe emerging theory of post-structuralism examines the significance of art within its cultural context, focusing on the ideas, emotions, and reactions that a work elicits. In this framework, the analysis may align with formalism and intentionalism when it emphasizes the artist's techniques and intentions. Conversely, in some instances, historical and material conditions may take precedence. Factors such as religious and philosophical beliefs, sociopolitical and economic structures, as well as climate and geography can significantly influence the interpretation of art.\n\nArt criticism continues to evolve alongside artistic practices. The term \"art\" can imply a sense of trained ability or mastery over a medium. It may also refer to the effective use of language to convey meaning with immediacy or depth. Art is fundamentally an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations. This expression often arises from a deep understanding of the material, cultivated through hands-on experience, which in turn enhances the artist's thought processes.",
    "Art analysis encompasses the methods employed by artists and the physical composition of their works, focusing primarily on non-semantic aspects, such as color, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, and value. The concept of form also includes design principles, which involve arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and rhythm.\n\nPhilosophical perspectives on art generally fall into three main schools of thought: formalism, content-based analysis, and contextualism. \n\n\nThere is a lack of consensus regarding the terminology used to describe informal properties of art. Some scholars refer to these aspects as subject matter and content, encompassing denotations and connotations, while others prefer terms such as meaning and significance.\n\n\nIn summary, the analysis of art involves a multifaceted approach that considers form, content, and context, allowing for a deeper understanding of artistic expression and its implications.",
    "Historically, the skill of execution has been regarded as an essential quality of art, integral to its success. For artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, art was a direct expression of skill, akin to his other pursuits. Rembrandt, whose work is now celebrated for its ephemeral qualities, was primarily admired by his contemporaries for his technical virtuosity.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, John Singer Sargent's adept performances garnered both admiration and skepticism regarding their manual fluency. Concurrently, Pablo Picasso, who would later become a prominent and influential figure in modern art, was excelling in traditional academic training.\n\nIn contemporary discourse, a common critique of certain modern art forms centers on the perceived lack of skill or technical ability involved in their creation. Notable examples include Marcel Duchamp's *Fountain*, which is recognized as one of the first instances of conceptual art, utilizing found objects or \"ready-mades\" without employing conventional artistic techniques. Similarly, Tracey Emin's *My Bed* and Damien Hirst's *The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living* exemplify this approach, engaging with mass media while challenging traditional notions of artistic skill.",
    "Imitation is a fundamental instinct of human nature. According to Aristotle, this instinct is complemented by a natural inclination toward harmony and rhythm, with meters serving as distinct segments of rhythm. Individuals, starting from this inherent ability, gradually develop their unique talents, ultimately leading to the creation of poetry through their initial improvisations.\n\n\nArt offers a pathway to explore one's relationship with the universe. This exploration often occurs spontaneously, as individuals engage with various forms of art, including music and poetry. Albert Einstein posited that the most profound experience one can have is the encounter with the mysterious, which he regarded as the foundation of all genuine art and science.\n\n\nArt serves as a medium for expressing imagination in ways that transcend the constraints of formal language. Unlike words, which are sequenced and carry specific meanings, art encompasses a diverse array of forms, symbols, and ideas, allowing for interpretations that are fluid and adaptable. For instance, the representation of Jupiter's eagle transcends mere logical attributes; it embodies the concepts of sublimity and majesty, inspiring the imagination to explore a multitude of related representations that provoke deeper contemplation than can be encapsulated by words alone.",
    "Damien Hirst is known for his conceptual design in artwork, often delegating the actual creation of many pieces to skilled artisans. His prominence in the art world is largely attributed to his ability to generate provocative concepts. In contemporary art, the production process frequently involves the assembly of found objects, a practice that has become a hallmark of conceptual art.\n\nDespite this trend, numerous modernist and contemporary artists continue to excel in traditional artistic skills, such as drawing and painting, creating works that require hands-on craftsmanship. \n\nThe purpose of art has varied significantly throughout history, making it challenging to define a singular concept. This diversity does not suggest that the purpose of art is ambiguous; rather, it reflects the multitude of unique reasons for its creation. The functions of art can be categorized into two main groups: non-motivated and motivated purposes, as outlined by anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss.\n\n\nNon-motivated purposes of art are those that are intrinsic to the human experience, transcending individual intent and not serving a specific external objective. In this context, art is viewed as a fundamental aspect of human nature, as no other species engages in artistic creation. Consequently, art exists beyond mere utility, driven by a basic human instinct for harmony, balance, and rhythm.",
    "In various cultures, art plays a significant role in rituals, performances, and dances, often serving as decoration or symbol. While these artistic expressions may not have a specific utilitarian purpose, anthropologists recognize that they often convey deeper meanings within their respective cultures. Such meanings are typically shaped over generations and reflect a cosmological relationship intrinsic to the culture.\n\nScholars who study rock paintings or artifacts from prehistoric contexts that lack utilitarian explanations often categorize these works as decorative, ritualistic, or symbolic. They acknowledge the complexities associated with the term \"art,\" which can lead to interpretive challenges. \n\n\nThe motivated purposes of art refer to the intentional and conscious actions undertaken by artists or creators. These purposes may include advocating for political change, commenting on societal issues, conveying specific emotions or moods, addressing personal psychological experiences, illustrating concepts from other disciplines, promoting commercial products, or serving as a means of communication.\n\nAt its core, art functions as a form of communication. Like other forms of communication, it typically has an intent or goal directed toward an audience, thereby embodying a motivated purpose.",
    "The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS) is a therapeutic tool utilized to assess the personality and emotional functioning of individuals. Unlike traditional assessments, the primary objective of the DDS is not the final artwork produced, but rather the healing process facilitated through creative expression. The artwork generated during this process can provide valuable insights into the individual's emotional challenges and may inform more conventional psychiatric treatment approaches.\n\n\nArt has long been employed as a medium for propaganda, serving to subtly influence public perceptions and emotions. Similarly, commercial art aims to evoke specific feelings that encourage consumer behavior. In both contexts, the intent is to guide the viewer's emotional or psychological response toward particular ideas or products.\n\n\nThe capacity of the human brain is often considered to exceed the requirements for survival in ancestral environments. One explanation from evolutionary psychology posits that traits such as artistic ability and creativity function similarly to the peacock's tail, which serves as an indicator of fitness to potential mates. This concept relates to theories such as Fisherian runaway and the handicap principle, suggesting that these traits may have evolved to enhance reproductive success.",
    "Research indicates that a significant majority of visual arts students recognize reflection as a crucial component of the artistic process. Educational journals emphasize that reflection is integral to the overall experience of creating and engaging with art. \n\nArt serves not only as a medium for personal expression but also as a means for others to view and appreciate its value. While discussions often center around the perceived quality or success of art among audiences, its significance extends beyond commercial success. Art plays a vital role in society by providing information and contributing to overall well-being. The enjoyment of art can evoke a diverse range of emotions, often stemming from its inherent beauty.\n\nAdditionally, some artworks are designed with practical purposes in mind, encouraging analytical discourse and stimulating conversation among viewers. \n\nHistorically, art has frequently been associated with displays of wealth and power, often characterized by grand scale and the use of costly materials. Many artworks have been commissioned by political leaders or religious institutions, with more accessible versions typically reserved for the affluent. However, there have been numerous periods in history when high-quality art was available to broader segments of society, particularly through affordable mediums such as pottery, which can endure over time, as well as through more ephemeral materials like textiles and wood. \n\nIn summary, the multifaceted nature of art encompasses personal reflection, societal engagement, and historical context, highlighting its enduring significance across cultures and eras.",
    "The building currently housing the Museo del Prado in Madrid was constructed prior to the French Revolution to facilitate the public display of portions of the royal art collection. Similar royal galleries accessible to the public were established in cities such as Vienna and Munich. The opening of the Musée du Louvre in 1793, during the French Revolution, marked a significant milestone in the evolution of public access to art, as it transitioned ownership of the former French royal collection to a republican state. This development, however, was part of a broader trend that had already begun.\n\nThe establishment of modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can largely be traced back to the desire to make art accessible to all. Museums serve not only to provide access to art but also to shape the audience's perception of it. Research indicates that museums play an active and significant role in influencing how art is understood and appreciated in contemporary society.\n\nIn the United States, many museums are established as gifts from affluent individuals to the general public. For instance, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City was founded by John Taylor Johnston, a railroad executive whose personal art collection served as the foundation for the museum.",
    "Art for social inquiry, subversion, or anarchy encompasses artistic practices that aim to question societal norms and provoke thought, often without a specific political agenda. Unlike art focused on political change, subversive or deconstructivist art critiques various aspects of society, encouraging viewers to reflect on their beliefs and values.\n\nOne prominent form of subversive art is graffiti, which includes street art created through spray-painting or stenciling on publicly visible surfaces such as walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, often without official permission. While graffiti can serve as a powerful medium for social commentary, it may also be deemed illegal when it violates laws against vandalism.\n\n\nArt serves as a vital tool for raising awareness about numerous social issues. Various artistic initiatives have been developed to highlight causes such as autism, cancer, human trafficking, ocean conservation, human rights violations in Darfur, the plight of murdered and missing Aboriginal women, elder abuse, and pollution. \n\nOne notable example is \"trashion,\" a movement that repurposes waste materials into fashion items, exemplified by artists like Marina DeBris. This approach not only promotes creativity but also raises awareness about environmental issues and the impact of pollution.\n\n\nArt is also recognized for its therapeutic potential, providing psychological benefits and promoting healing. Various art forms are utilized in therapeutic settings to support mental health, foster emotional expression, and facilitate personal growth. Through creative engagement, individuals can explore their feelings, confront challenges, and enhance their overall well-being.",
    "The functions of art are not mutually exclusive; many may overlap. For instance, art created for entertainment purposes may also serve commercial objectives, such as promoting a movie or video game.\n\n\nThe creative process can be divided into various steps, although there is no universal agreement on the exact number. This section outlines three broad stages: preparation, creation, and reflection.\n\nIn the initial stage, the artist envisions the artwork in their mind. This involves imagining the final piece and beginning the journey to bring it into existence. Preparation may also include researching the subject matter and gathering inspiration. Artistic inspiration often arises from instinct, impressions, and emotions.\n\nThe second stage involves the actual execution of the artwork. Various factors, such as the artist's mood, environment, and mental state, can influence this process. For example, Francisco de Goya's \"Black Paintings,\" created during his later years, are characterized by their somber themes, likely reflecting his isolation and experiences during wartime. Goya painted these works directly on the walls of his apartment in Spain and reportedly did not discuss them with anyone. Similarly, members of The Beatles have noted that substances like LSD and cannabis played a role in shaping some of their most iconic songs, including those on the album \"Revolver.\" The process of trial and error is often an integral part of creation, allowing artists to explore and refine their ideas.\n\nWhile not explicitly outlined in the original text, reflection is a crucial component of the artistic process. After completing a work, artists often assess their creation, considering its impact and the emotions it evokes. This stage can lead to further inspiration and inform future projects.\n\nIn summary, the artistic process is multifaceted, encompassing preparation, creation, and reflection, each contributing to the overall experience and outcome of the artwork.",
    "Egyptian temples are characterized by their grand and elaborate decorations, primarily located in areas visible to the general public. This design choice contrasts with the more austere sections reserved for priests, which were less accessible. \n\nIn addition to temples, many royal palaces, castles, and residences of the social elite often allowed public access to certain areas. Art collections within these spaces could frequently be viewed by the public, either for free or for a nominal fee. Access was sometimes regulated by specific dress codes, as exemplified by the Palace of Versailles, where visitors could rent accessories such as silver shoe buckles and swords to meet the required attire.\n\nSpecial arrangements were also made to enable public viewings of royal and private collections. For instance, the Orleans Collection, primarily housed in a wing of the Palais Royal in Paris, was open to visitors for much of the 18th century. \n\nIn Italy, the phenomenon of art tourism, particularly during the Grand Tour, emerged as a significant industry from the Renaissance onward. Governments and cities actively promoted access to their key artistic works, further enhancing the cultural experience for visitors.",
    "Art serves as a multifaceted medium for communication, conveying not only scientific concepts but also emotions, moods, and feelings. According to Steve Mithen, art comprises artifacts or images imbued with symbolic meanings, functioning as a means of communication.\n\n\nArt often aims to evoke specific emotions or moods, providing relaxation or entertainment for the viewer. This purpose is particularly evident in the art industries, including motion pictures and video games, where the primary goal is to engage and entertain audiences.\n\n\nA significant aspect of early 20th-century art was its role in advocating for political change. Various art movements, such as Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, collectively known as the avant-garde, sought to challenge societal norms and provoke thought through visual imagery.\n\n\nThe realistic attitude, influenced by positivism and spanning from thinkers like Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, has been critiqued for its perceived hostility towards intellectual and moral advancement. André Breton, a prominent figure in Surrealism, expressed disdain for this perspective, describing it as a source of mediocrity and a hindrance to both science and art. He argued that such an attitude fosters a culture that caters to the lowest common denominator, ultimately stifling creativity and innovation.\n\n\nArt is often viewed as a \"free zone,\" a space where creators can explore ideas without the constraints of societal censure. This freedom allows for the exploration of diverse themes and perspectives, contributing to the rich tapestry of artistic expression.",
    "Reproductive methods, such as molds, facilitated mass production and enabled the distribution of high-quality Ancient Roman pottery and Greek Tanagra figurines to a broad market. Cylinder seals, which served both artistic and practical purposes, were widely utilized by the emerging middle class in the Ancient Near East. \n\nWith the advent of coinage, coins evolved into an art form that permeated various societal levels. A significant innovation occurred in the 15th century in Europe, when printmaking began with small woodcuts, predominantly religious in nature. These prints were often small, hand-colored, and affordable, allowing even peasants to decorate their homes by gluing them to the walls.\n\nInitially, printed books were costly, but their prices steadily decreased, making them accessible to the poorer segments of society by the 19th century. For centuries, popular prints of diverse types have adorned homes and public spaces.\n\nIn 1661, Basel, Switzerland, established the first public art museum in the world, the Kunstmuseum Basel. The museum's collection spans an impressive historical range, from the early 15th century to the present day. Its focus areas contribute to its international reputation as one of the most significant museums of its kind, featuring paintings and drawings by artists active in the Upper Rhine region between 1400 and 1600, as well as works from the 19th to 21st centuries.",
    "Throughout history, artists have sought to create works that resist commodification and cannot be acquired by the wealthy as mere status symbols. A significant motivation for many artists during the late 1960s and 1970s was to produce art that transcended traditional buying and selling. Prominent post-war German artist Joseph Beuys articulated this sentiment, stating, \"It is necessary to present something more than mere objects.\"\n\nThis era witnessed the emergence of various art forms, including performance art, video art, and conceptual art. The underlying principle was that if an artwork existed as a performance or an idea, it could not be commodified. The notion that art should not be treated as a commodity spurred aesthetic innovations that flourished in the mid-1960s and continued throughout the 1970s. Artists associated with Conceptual art often replaced traditional material forms with performance and publishing activities, aiming to challenge the perception of the art object as a mere commodity.\n\nIn subsequent decades, however, the initial intentions behind these movements have been somewhat overshadowed. The art market has adapted by finding ways to monetize these non-traditional forms, such as selling limited edition DVDs of video works, offering exclusive invitations to performance art events, and marketing the remnants of conceptual pieces. This evolution raises questions about the ongoing tension between artistic intent and market dynamics.",
    "In contemporary discussions of art, the marker of status has shifted from ownership to understanding the work itself. This evolution suggests that engagement with art is increasingly seen as an upper-class activity. The advent of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s provided artists and the gallery system with a significant tool for managing the distribution of video and computer artworks. This technology enabled the sale of limited editions to collectors, thereby enhancing the control artists have over their work.\n\n\nArt has historically been a source of controversy, often eliciting strong reactions from viewers for various reasons. Many pre-modern controversies are poorly documented or have been lost to contemporary understanding. \n\n\nAdditionally, art has faced criticism for its portrayal of unpopular figures, political parties, or groups. Artistic conventions, often upheld by critics, can be conservative and rigorously enforced, although public reception may vary. The iconographic content of artworks can also provoke controversy, as seen in late medieval depictions of the Swoon of the Virgin during the Crucifixion of Jesus.",
    "Throughout history, the content of formal art has often been influenced by patrons or commissioners rather than solely by the artists themselves. However, with the emergence of Romanticism and significant economic changes in art production, the artist's vision increasingly became the primary determinant of artistic content. This shift led to a rise in controversies surrounding artworks, although the significance of these controversies varied.\n\nArtists were motivated by strong incentives for originality and public attention, which often encouraged them to engage in controversial themes. For instance, Théodore Géricault's \nJohn Singer Sargent's \nThe gradual departure from naturalism and the realistic depiction of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries contributed to a protracted period of artistic controversy, lasting over a century. This evolution reflects the ongoing dialogue between artists and societal expectations, highlighting the complex relationship between art, culture, and public perception.",
    "The act of creating a work of art, while potentially interesting, does not necessarily influence its correct interpretation. Gaut and Livingston distinguish between two critical approaches: intentionalism and formalism. Intentionalists assert that understanding the creator's intentions is vital for accurately interpreting a work, whereas formalists maintain that the work should be analyzed independently of the creator's intentions.\n\nRichard Wollheim emphasizes this perspective by stating, \"The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself.\" This highlights the belief that the intentions behind a work are integral to its meaning.\n\n\nThe late 20th century gave rise to a significant discourse known as the linguistic turn controversy, often referred to as the \"innocent eye debate\" within the philosophy of art. This debate centers on the relationship between language, interpretation, and the perception of art, further complicating the discussions surrounding intentionalism and formalism.",
    "Pop art emerged as a significant movement in the mid-20th century, with artists such as Andy Warhol gaining prominence for their works that both celebrated and critiqued popular culture and the art world itself. This movement laid the groundwork for subsequent generations of artists in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, who expanded the practice of self-criticism to encompass a broader range of cultural image-making. This included not only fine art but also fashion imagery, comics, billboards, and pornography.\n\nThe conceptual foundations of pop art can be traced back to the ideas of Marcel Duchamp, who suggested that art encompasses any activity. This perspective raises questions about the criteria by which certain activities are classified as art today, highlighting the notion that these classifications are socially constructed. \n\nIn \"The Invention of Art: A Cultural History,\" Larry Shiner explores the evolution of the modern art system, specifically the distinction between fine art and other forms of creative expression. He argues that the ancient Greek society did not have a term equivalent to \"art\"; instead, they used the word \"techne.\" This term encompassed a wide range of skilled human activities, including painting, sculpture, and music, as well as cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and farming. The contemporary distinctions between art and craft are thus viewed as historical constructs that emerged later in human history. \n\nOverall, the pop art movement and its subsequent developments reflect a complex interplay between cultural critique and the evolving definitions of art.",
    "The emergence of the New Criticism school sparked significant debate regarding the intentional fallacy. This concept revolves around the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of an artist should influence the criticism and evaluation of their work. Specifically, it examines whether a work of art should be assessed based on its own merits, independent of the artist's intentions.\n\nIn 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a seminal and contentious essay titled \"The Intentional Fallacy.\" In this work, they argued against the relevance of an author's intention, or \"intended meaning,\" in the analysis of literary texts. Wimsatt and Beardsley posited that the text itself should be the sole focus of literary analysis, asserting that any external meanings derived from the author's intentions could be distracting and irrelevant.\n\nIn conjunction with this essay, Wimsatt and Beardsley also authored \"The Affective Fallacy,\" which addressed the role of the reader's personal and emotional responses in literary analysis. They contended that such reactions should not be considered valid means of evaluating a text. This perspective was later challenged by theorists associated with the reader-response school of literary theory. Notably, Stanley Fish, a prominent figure in this movement, was initially trained in New Criticism and critiqued Wimsatt and Beardsley in his 1970 essay \"Literature in the Reader.\" \n\nThe discussions surrounding the intentional and affective fallacies continue to influence literary criticism and theory, highlighting the ongoing tension between authorial intent, textual analysis, and reader interpretation.",
    "The linguistic turn in art history and the humanities has been significantly influenced by the structuralism of Ferdinand de Saussure and the subsequent movement of poststructuralism. In 1981, artist Mark Tansey created a notable work titled \nKey theorists in this discourse include Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida. The role of language, particularly certain rhetorical tropes, in shaping art history and historical discourse has been examined by Hayden White. This perspective emphasizes that language is not merely a transparent medium for conveying thought, a notion also highlighted by philosophers Johann Georg Hamann and Wilhelm von Humboldt.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, scholars such as Ernst Gombrich and Nelson Goodman, in his work *Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols*, argued that the conceptual engagement with a work of art took precedence over its perceptual and visual experience. This shift in focus has had lasting implications for the study of art and its interpretation within the broader context of humanities."
