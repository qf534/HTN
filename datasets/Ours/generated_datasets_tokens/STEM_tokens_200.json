    "Biology is the scientific study of life. It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field. For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life. Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments. Biologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization, from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations. Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use. Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world",
    "History The earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions shaped ancient Greek natural philosophy. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge. He explored biological causation and the diversity of life. His successor, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants. Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany, and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought. Biology began to quickly develop with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvement of the microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria,",
    "However, Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow were able to reify the third tenet, and by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets which consolidated into cell theory. Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735, and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who presented a coherent theory of evolution. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection",
    "In the 1940s and early 1950s, a series of experiments by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s onwards, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 to map the human genome. Chemical basis Atoms and molecules All organisms are made up of chemical elements; oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium,",
    "Water Life arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago. Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life. In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O). Because the O–H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge. This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive. Surface tension results from the cohesive",
    "Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor. As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again. In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral. Organic compounds Organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen. With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon. Carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules. For example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane, two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide (CO2), or a triple covalent bond such as in carbon monoxide (CO).",
    "Groups of atoms that contain these elements (O-, H-, P-, and S-) and are bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton are called functional groups. There are six prominent functional groups that can be found in organisms: amino group, carboxyl group, carbonyl group, hydroxyl group, phosphate group, and sulfhydryl group. In 1953, the Miller–Urey experiment showed that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically within a closed system mimicking the conditions of early Earth, thus suggesting that complex organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously in early Earth (see abiogenesis). Macromolecules Macromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or monomers. Monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides. Carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars. Lipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. They include steroids, phospholipids",
    "Most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers and are therefore only visible under a light or electron microscope. There are generally two types of cells: eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which do not. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body is derived ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. Cell structure Every cell is enclosed within a cell membrane that separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular space. A cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures. Cell membranes are semipermeable, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules",
    "Within the cytoplasm of a cell, there are many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to biomolecules, eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called organelles that have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units. These organelles include the cell nucleus, which contains most of the cell's DNA, or mitochondria, which generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to power cellular processes. Other organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus play a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively. Biomolecules such as proteins can be engulfed by lysosomes, another specialized organelle. Plant cells have additional organelles that distinguish them from animal cells such as a cell wall that provides support for the plant cell, chloroplasts that harvest sunlight energy to produce sugar, and vacuoles that provide storage and structural support as well as being involved",
    "Microfilaments are made up of actin molecules that interact with other strands of proteins. Metabolism All cells require energy to sustain cellular processes. Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions in an organism. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of metabolic wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or anabolic—the building up (synthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is",
    "Enzymes also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells. Cellular respiration Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions. Sugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is called",
    "Acetyl-Coa enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. Oxidative phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a series of four protein complexes that transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH2 that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (chemiosmosis), which generates a proton motive force. Energy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme ATP synthase to synthesize more ATPs by phosphorylating ADPs. The transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final electron acceptor",
    "This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen. Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other",
    "Photosynthesis has four stages: Light absorption, electron transport, ATP synthesis, and carbon fixation. Light absorption is the initial step of photosynthesis whereby light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments attached to proteins in the thylakoid membranes. The absorbed light energy is used to remove electrons from a donor (water) to a primary electron acceptor, a quinone designated as Q. In the second stage, electrons move from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of NADP+, which is reduced to NADPH, a process that takes place in a protein complex called photosystem I (PSI). The transport of electrons is coupled to the movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a pH gradient across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma. This is",
    "Cell signaling Cell signaling (or communication) is the ability of cells to receive, process, and transmit signals with its environment and with itself. Signals can be non-chemical such as light, electrical impulses, and heat, or chemical signals (or ligands) that interact with receptors, which can be found embedded in the cell membrane of another cell or located deep inside a cell. There are generally four types of chemical signals: autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and hormones. In autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it. Tumor cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division. In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them. For example, brain cells called neurons release ligands called neurotransmitters that diffuse across a synaptic cleft to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or muscle cell. In ju",
    "Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an inotropic receptor can alter the excitability of a target cell. Other types of receptors include protein kinase receptors (e.g., receptor for the hormone insulin) and G protein-coupled receptors. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors can initiate second messenger cascades. The process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events is called signal transduction Cell cycle The cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell that cause it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the duplication of its DNA and some of its organelles, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotes (i.e., animal, plant, fungal",
    "The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells. The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions. Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division (meiosis I), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division (meiosis II). Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Prokaryotes (i.e.,",
    "The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA rods, ribosomes, and plasmids. Sexual reproduction and meiosis Meiosis is a central feature of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, and the most fundamental function of meiosis appears to be conservation of the integrity of the genome that is passed on to progeny by parents. Two aspects of sexual reproduction, meiotic recombination and outcrossing, are likely maintained respectively by the adaptive advantages of recombinational repair of genomic DNA damage and genetic complementation which masks the expression of deleterious recessive mutations. The beneficial effect of genetic complementation, derived from outcrossing (cross-fertilization) is also referred to as hybrid vigor or heterosis. Charles Darwin in his 1878 book The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilization in the Vegetable Kingdom at the start of chapter XII noted “The first and most important of the conclusions which may be drawn from the observations given in this volume",
    "Mendelian inheritance, specifically, is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring. It has several principles. The first is that genetic characteristics, alleles, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs. white or tall vs. dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents. Based on the law of dominance and uniformity, which states that some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the phenotype of that dominant allele. During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. Heterozygotic individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles. Finally, the law of independent assortment, states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked. An exception to this rule would include traits that are",
    "DNA is composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. It is found as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes in a cell is collectively known as its genome. In eukaryotes, DNA is mainly in the cell nucleus. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within the nucleoid. The genetic information is held within genes, and the complete assemblage in an organism is called its genotype. DNA replication is a semiconservative process whereby each strand serves as a template for a new strand of DNA. Mutations are heritable changes in DNA. They can arise spontaneously as a result of replication errors that were not corrected by proofreading or can be induced by an environmental mutagen such as a chemical (e.g., nitrous acid, benzopyrene) or radiation (e.g., x-ray, gamma ray, ultraviolet radiation",
    "This process is summarized by the central dogma of molecular biology, which was formulated by Francis Crick in 1958. According to the Central Dogma, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. There are two gene expression processes: transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein). Gene regulation The regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages of development can occur at each step of the process such as transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called transcription factors bind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter. A cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an operon, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans). In positive regulation of gene expression, the activator is the transcription factor that stimulates",
    "In contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation. In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells. Genes, development, and evolution Development is the process by which a multicellular organism (plant or animal) goes through a series of changes, starting from a single cell, and taking on various forms that are characteristic of its life cycle. There are four key processes that underlie development: Determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth. Determination sets the developmental fate of a cell, which becomes more restrictive during development. Differentiation is the process by which specialized cells from less specialized cells such as stem cells. Stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can differentiate into various types of cells and proliferate indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell. Cellular differentiation dramatically changes a cell",
    "Morphogenesis, or the development of body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression. A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome called the developmental-genetic toolkit control the development of that organism. These toolkit genes are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva. Evolution Evolutionary processes Evolution is a central organizing concept in biology. It is the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations. In artificial selection, animals were selectively bred for specific traits. Given that traits are inherited, populations contain a varied mix of traits, and reproduction is able to increase any population",
    "Speciation A species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other. For speciation to occur, there has to be reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model. Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with genetic divergence. Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as allopatric speciation. Phylogeny A phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes. It can be represented using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes. Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a lineage of descendants of a particular species or population. When a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the",
    "All organisms can be classified as belonging to one of three domains: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); bacteria (originally eubacteria), or eukarya (includes the protist, fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms). History of life The history of life on Earth traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on Earth, both living and extinct, descended from a last universal common ancestor that lived about 3.5 billion years ago. Geologists have developed a geologic time scale that divides the history of the Earth into major divisions, starting with four eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic), the first three of which are collectively known as the Precambrian, which lasted approximately 4 billion years. Each eon can be divided into eras, with the Phanerozoic eon that began 539 million",
    "The earliest evidence of eukaryotes dates from 1.85 billion years ago, and while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their metabolism. Later, around 1.7 billion years ago, multicellular organisms began to appear, with differentiated cells performing specialised functions. Algae-like multicellular land plants are dated back even to about 1 billion years ago, although evidence suggests that microorganisms formed the earliest terrestrial ecosystems, at least 2.7 billion years ago. Microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the Ordovician period. Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the Late Devonian extinction event. Ediacara biota appear during the Ediacaran period, while vertebrates, along with most other modern phyla originated about 525 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion. During the Permian period, synapsids, including the ancestors of",

Typically a few micrometers in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of the Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory. Archae",

Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon, but unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea form endospores. The first observed archaea were extremophiles, living in extreme environments",
    "Eukaryotes Eukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their endosymbioses with bacteria (or symbiogenesis) that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern-day eukaryotic cells. The major lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the Precambrian about 1.5 billion years ago and can be classified into eight major clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and animals. Five of these clades are collectively known as protists, which are mostly microscopic eukaryotic organisms that are not plants, fungi, or animals. While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor (the last eukaryotic common ancestor), protists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be more closely related",
    "The first several clades that emerged following primary endosymbiosis were aquatic and most of the aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms are collectively described as algae, which is a term of convenience as not all algae are closely related. Algae comprise several distinct clades such as glaucophytes, which are microscopic freshwater algae that may have resembled in form to the early unicellular ancestor of Plantae. Unlike glaucophytes, the other algal clades such as red and green algae are multicellular. Green algae comprise three major clades: chlorophytes, coleochaetophytes, and stoneworts. Fungi are eukaryotes that digest foods outside their bodies, secreting digestive enzymes that break down large food molecules before absorbing them through their cell membranes.

As electrons move through these complexes, energy is released, which is utilized to pump protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton motive force through a process known as chemiosmosis.\n\nThe energy generated from the proton motive force drives the enzyme ATP synthase, enabling the synthesis of additional ATP by phosphorylating",
    "Enzymes play a crucial role in regulating the rate of metabolic reactions. They enable cells to respond to changes in their environment and to signals from other cells.\n\n\nCellular respiration encompasses a series of metabolic reactions and processes that occur within cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), while simultaneously releasing waste products. The reactions involved in cellular respiration are primarily catabolic, meaning they break down larger molecules into smaller ones, thereby releasing energy. This process is essential for cells to harness chemical energy to fuel various cellular activities.\n\nThe overall process of cellular respiration occurs through a sequence of biochemical steps, some of which involve redox reactions. Although cellular respiration can be classified as a combustion reaction, it differs significantly from typical combustion due to the slow and controlled release of energy throughout these reactions.\n\nIn both animal and plant cells, glucose serves as the primary nutrient utilized during cellular respiration. When oxygen is present, the",
    "Fermentation is a metabolic process that varies among different organisms, resulting in distinct waste products. In skeletal muscles, the primary waste product is lactic acid, produced during a process known as lactic acid fermentation. This occurs during strenuous exercise when energy demands surpass the available energy supply. Under these conditions, the respiratory chain is unable to process all hydrogen atoms associated with NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ is regenerated when pairs of hydrogen atoms combine with pyruvate to form lactate. This reaction is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase and is reversible. Lactate can also serve as an indirect precursor for glycogen synthesis in the liver. Upon recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ reattaches to hydrogen from lactate, facilitating the production of ATP.\n\nIn yeast, the waste products of fermentation are ethanol and carbon dioxide, a process referred to as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process occurs through substrate",
    "Microfilaments are cytoskeletal structures composed primarily of actin molecules. These actin filaments interact with various proteins, contributing to numerous cellular functions, including maintaining cell shape, enabling motility, and facilitating intracellular transport.\n\nMetabolism encompasses the entirety of chemical reactions occurring within an organism. It is essential for sustaining cellular processes and can be divided into two primary categories: catabolism and anabolism.\n\n1. \n2. \nThe overall functions of metabolism can be summarized as follows:\n- The conversion of food into energy to power cellular activities.\n- The transformation of food and fuel into monomer building blocks necessary for growth and repair.\n- The removal of metabolic waste products.\n\nMetabolic reactions are organized into metabolic pathways, where one chemical is transformed into another through a series of enzymatically facilitated steps. Enzymes play a critical role in metabolism by enabling reactions that would not occur spontaneously. They achieve this",
    "Mitosis is a critical phase of the cell cycle in animal cells, characterized by the division of a single mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells. This process is essential for growth, development, and tissue repair in multicellular organisms. The cell cycle encompasses various stages, including interphase, during which the cell prepares for division.\n\nIn contrast to mitosis, meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that results in four haploid daughter cells. Meiosis involves one round of DNA replication followed by two distinct divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated, while sister chromatids are separated during meiosis II. Both mitosis and meiosis play significant roles in sexual reproduction and are believed to have originated in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes.\n\nProkaryotes, such as archaea and bacteria, also undergo cell division, primarily through a process known as binary fission. Unlike mit",
    "The newly formed daughter cells contain tightly coiled DNA, ribosomes, and plasmids. \n\n\nMeiosis is a fundamental process in sexual reproduction among eukaryotes, primarily serving to preserve the integrity of the genome that is transmitted from parents to offspring. Two key components of sexual reproduction—meiotic recombination and outcrossing—are believed to be maintained due to their adaptive advantages. Meiotic recombination facilitates the repair of genomic DNA damage, while outcrossing enhances genetic complementation, which can mask the expression of harmful recessive mutations.\n\nThe beneficial effects of genetic complementation arising from outcrossing, also known as hybrid vigor or heterosis, contribute to the overall fitness of a population. Charles Darwin, in his 1878 work \nAdditionally, genetic variation, which often results from sexual reproduction, may provide long-term advantages to lineages that engage in outcrossing, enhancing their adaptability and survival.",
    "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix structure. In eukaryotic organisms, DNA is organized into linear chromosomes, whereas in prokaryotic organisms, it exists as circular chromosomes. The complete set of chromosomes within a cell is referred to as its genome.\n\nIn eukaryotes, DNA is primarily located in the cell nucleus, while in prokaryotes, it is found in a region called the nucleoid. Genetic information is encoded within segments of DNA known as genes, and the entire collection of genes in an organism constitutes its genotype.\n\nDNA replication is a semiconservative process, meaning that each original strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. Mutations, which are heritable changes in the DNA sequence, can occur spontaneously due to errors during replication that are not corrected by proofreading mechanisms. Additionally,",
    "Mendelian inheritance refers to the principles governing the transmission of genetic traits from parents to offspring. This process is based on several key principles established by Gregor Mendel through his experiments with pea plants.\n\nOne fundamental principle is that genetic characteristics, known as alleles, exist in discrete forms. For example, traits such as flower color can be represented by alleles for purple or white flowers, while plant height can be represented by alleles for tall or dwarf plants. Each offspring inherits one allele from each parent.\n\nAccording to the law of dominance, some alleles are dominant, while others are recessive. An organism possessing at least one dominant allele will exhibit the phenotype associated with that dominant allele. During the formation of gametes, the alleles for each gene segregate, ensuring that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. In heterozygous individuals, gametes are produced with equal frequencies of the two alleles.\n\nThe",
    "When a ligand binds to a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the receptor type. For example, neurotransmitters that interact with ionotropic receptors can modify the excitability of target cells. Other receptor types include protein kinase receptors, such as the insulin receptor, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The activation of GPCRs can initiate cascades involving second messengers, which play a crucial role in cellular signaling.\n\n\nThe process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell, involving a series of molecular events, is known as signal transduction.\n\n\nThe cell cycle is a sequence of events that occur in a cell, leading to its division into two daughter cells. This process includes the duplication of DNA and certain organelles, followed by the partitioning of the cytoplasm in a process known as cell division. In eukaryotic organisms—such as animals, plants, fungi",
    "Morphogenesis, the process by which organisms develop their body forms, results from spatial differences in gene expression. A subset of genes within an organism's genome, known as the developmental-genetic toolkit, plays a crucial role in this development. These toolkit genes are highly conserved across various phyla, indicating their ancient origins and similarity among diverse animal groups. Variations in the expression and deployment of these toolkit genes influence the body plan, as well as the number, identity, and arrangement of body parts.\n\nAmong the most significant of these toolkit genes are the Hox genes. Hox genes are essential in determining the locations of repeating structures, such as the vertebrae in snakes, during the development of embryos or larvae.\n\n\nEvolution is a fundamental concept in biology, defined as the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations. One form of evolution is artificial selection, where humans selectively breed animals for specific traits. Since traits are inherited,",
    "A species is defined as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Speciation is the evolutionary process through which a single lineage diverges into two distinct lineages, resulting from independent evolutionary paths. For speciation to occur, reproductive isolation is essential. This isolation can arise from genetic incompatibilities, as explained by the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model. Additionally, reproductive isolation tends to increase with genetic divergence.\n\nSpeciation can occur through various mechanisms, one of which is allopatric speciation. This process takes place when physical barriers, such as mountains or rivers, separate an ancestral species, leading to the development of distinct populations over time.\n\n\nPhylogeny refers to the evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes. It is often illustrated using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram that depicts the lines of descent among organisms or their genetic material. Each line on the time axis of a phylogenetic",
    "The earliest evidence of eukaryotic life dates back approximately 1.85 billion years. While it is possible that eukaryotes existed prior to this, their diversification is believed to have accelerated with the advent of oxygen-utilizing metabolic processes. Around 1.7 billion years ago, multicellular organisms began to emerge, featuring differentiated cells that performed specialized functions.\n\nAlgae-like multicellular land plants are estimated to have appeared around 1 billion years ago. However, evidence indicates that microorganisms were the foundation of the earliest terrestrial ecosystems, existing at least 2.7 billion years ago. These microorganisms are thought to have facilitated the emergence of land plants during the Ordovician period. The success of land plants is significant, as they are believed to have played a role in the Late Devonian extinction event.\n\nThe Ediacara biota emerged during the Ediacaran period, marking a notable point in the history of life. Most modern phyla,",
    "The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago, resulted in the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This event allowed mammals to rapidly increase in size and diversity. Mass extinctions can accelerate evolutionary processes by creating opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify and thrive.\n\n\n\nBacteria are a major domain of prokaryotic microorganisms, typically measuring a few micrometers in length. They exhibit a variety of shapes, including spheres, rods, and spirals. Bacteria are among the earliest life forms on Earth and can be found in diverse habitats, including soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of the Earth's crust. They also engage in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. \n\nDespite their prevalence, most bacterial species remain uncharacterized, with only about 27 percent of known bacterial phyla containing species that can be cultivated in laboratory settings.\n\nArch",
    "All organisms are classified into one of three domains: Archaea (formerly known as Archaebacteria), Bacteria (previously referred to as Eubacteria), and Eukarya, which encompasses the kingdoms of Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.\n\n\nThe history of life on Earth outlines the evolutionary journey of organisms from the earliest forms of life to the present day. Earth formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, and all life, both extant and extinct, is believed to have descended from a last universal common ancestor that existed around 3.5 billion years ago.\n\nGeologists have established a geologic time scale that segments Earth's history into major divisions, beginning with four eons: Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic. The first three eons are collectively referred to as the Precambrian, which spanned nearly 4 billion years. Each eon can be further divided into eras",
    "The central dogma of molecular biology, formulated by Francis Crick in 1958, describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. According to this framework, genetic information is transferred from DNA to RNA and then to protein. This process involves two primary mechanisms: transcription and translation.\n\n\n1. 2. \n\nGene expression is regulated by various environmental factors and developmental stages, and this regulation can occur at multiple points in the process, including transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of proteins. \n\nGene expression can be influenced by two types of regulatory mechanisms: positive regulation and negative regulation.\n\n-   \n- \n\nAn operon is a cluster of genes that share a common promoter and are typically found in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes, such as \nRepressors can be inhibited by molecules known as inducers (for example, allolactose), which allow transcription to proceed",
    "Structural genes are responsible for encoding proteins that do not play a role in gene regulation. Gene expression can be regulated through various mechanisms, including regulatory events associated with the promoter region and epigenetic modifications to chromatin. Chromatin is a complex of DNA and proteins found in eukaryotic cells that can influence gene activity without altering the underlying DNA sequence.\n\n\nDevelopment refers to the series of changes that a multicellular organism, whether plant or animal, undergoes from a single cell to various forms characteristic of its life cycle. Four essential processes underpin development: determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth.\n\n1.    \n2. \n3. \n4. \nCellular differentiation leads to significant changes in a cell's size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals. These changes are primarily driven by tightly regulated modifications in gene expression and epigenetic factors. Notably, with few exceptions, cellular differentiation does not involve alterations",
    "Eukaryotes are believed to have diverged from archaea, followed by endosymbiotic events with bacteria that led to the formation of mitochondria and chloroplasts. These organelles are now integral components of modern eukaryotic cells. The major lineages of eukaryotes began to diversify during the Precambrian period, approximately 1.5 billion years ago. Eukaryotes can be classified into eight primary clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and animals.\n\nFive of these clades are grouped together as protists, which primarily consist of microscopic eukaryotic organisms that do not fall under the categories of plants, fungi, or animals. While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor, known as the last eukaryotic common ancestor, they do not form a distinct clade. Some protists",

Conservation biologists study the trends associated with biodiversity loss and species extinctions, highlighting the adverse effects these phenomena have on the ability to sustain human societies.\n\nIn response to the ongoing biodiversity crisis, various organizations and individuals are implementing conservation action plans. These initiatives focus on directing research, monitoring, and educational programs that address concerns at both local and global levels. Through these efforts, stakeholders aim to enhance understanding and promote strategies for preserving biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services.",
    "Archaeal biochemistry features distinctive traits, such as the presence of ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea exhibit a broader range of energy sources compared to eukaryotes, utilizing organic compounds like sugars, as well as inorganic substances such as ammonia, metal ions, and hydrogen gas. Among the salt-tolerant archaea, known as Haloarchaea, some species harness sunlight as an energy source, while others are capable of carbon fixation. However, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea can perform both functions simultaneously.\n\nReproduction in archaea occurs asexually through methods such as binary fission, fragmentation, or budding. Notably, unlike bacteria, no known species of archaea produce endospores. The initial discoveries of archaea were primarily of extremophiles, organisms thriving in extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes devoid of other life forms. \n\nAdvancements in molecular",
    "Ecological interactions can be categorized as either short-term or long-term, both of which significantly influence the evolution of the species involved. Long-term interactions are referred to as symbiosis, which encompasses a range of relationships from mutualism, where both partners benefit, to competition, which can be detrimental to both.\n\nEvery species engages in consumer-resource interactions, which are fundamental to the structure of food chains and food webs. Within any food web, there are various trophic levels. The lowest level consists of primary producers, also known as autotrophs, such as plants and algae. These organisms convert energy and inorganic materials into organic compounds, serving as a vital resource for the rest of the community.\n\nThe next level comprises heterotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down organic compounds from other organisms. Heterotrophs that consume plants are classified as primary consumers or herbivores. Those that feed on herbivores are termed secondary consumers"
