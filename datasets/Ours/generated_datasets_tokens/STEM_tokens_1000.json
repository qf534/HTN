    "Biology is the scientific study of life. It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field. For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life. Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments. Biologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization, from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations. Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use. Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them. Life on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago, is immensely diverse. Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals.",
    "History The earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions shaped ancient Greek natural philosophy. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge. He explored biological causation and the diversity of life. His successor, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants. Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany, and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought. Biology began to quickly develop with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvement of the microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop techniques of microscopic dissection and staining. Advances in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell.",
    "However, Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow were able to reify the third tenet, and by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets which consolidated into cell theory. Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735, and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who presented a coherent theory of evolution. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar reasoning and evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions. The basis for modern genetics began with the work of Gregor Mendel in 1865. This outlined the principles of biological inheritance.",
    "In the 1940s and early 1950s, a series of experiments by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s onwards, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 to map the human genome. Chemical basis Atoms and molecules All organisms are made up of chemical elements; oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder. Different elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life. Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms.",
    "Water Life arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago. Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life. In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O). Because the O–H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge. This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive. Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid. Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules. Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice). This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above.",
    "Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor. As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again. In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral. Organic compounds Organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen. With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon. Carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules. For example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane, two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide (CO2), or a triple covalent bond such as in carbon monoxide (CO). Moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbon–carbon bonds such as octane or ring-like structures such as glucose. The simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon, which is a large family of organic compounds that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms.",
    "Groups of atoms that contain these elements (O-, H-, P-, and S-) and are bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton are called functional groups. There are six prominent functional groups that can be found in organisms: amino group, carboxyl group, carbonyl group, hydroxyl group, phosphate group, and sulfhydryl group. In 1953, the Miller–Urey experiment showed that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically within a closed system mimicking the conditions of early Earth, thus suggesting that complex organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously in early Earth (see abiogenesis). Macromolecules Macromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or monomers. Monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides. Carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars. Lipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. They include steroids, phospholipids, and fats, largely nonpolar and hydrophobic (water-repelling) substances. Proteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules. They include enzymes, transport proteins, large signaling molecules, antibodies, and structural proteins. The basic unit (or monomer) of a protein is an amino acid. Twenty amino acids are used in proteins. Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides. Their function is to store, transmit, and express hereditary information.",
    "Most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers and are therefore only visible under a light or electron microscope. There are generally two types of cells: eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which do not. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body is derived ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. Cell structure Every cell is enclosed within a cell membrane that separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular space. A cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures. Cell membranes are semipermeable, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles such as ions. Cell membranes also contains membrane proteins, including integral membrane proteins that go across the membrane serving as membrane transporters, and peripheral proteins that loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane, acting as enzymes shaping the cell.",
    "Within the cytoplasm of a cell, there are many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to biomolecules, eukaryotic cells have specialized structures called organelles that have their own lipid bilayers or are spatially units. These organelles include the cell nucleus, which contains most of the cell's DNA, or mitochondria, which generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to power cellular processes. Other organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus play a role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, respectively. Biomolecules such as proteins can be engulfed by lysosomes, another specialized organelle. Plant cells have additional organelles that distinguish them from animal cells such as a cell wall that provides support for the plant cell, chloroplasts that harvest sunlight energy to produce sugar, and vacuoles that provide storage and structural support as well as being involved in reproduction and breakdown of plant seeds. Eukaryotic cells also have cytoskeleton that is made up of microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments, all of which provide support for the cell and are involved in the movement of the cell and its organelles.",
    "Microfilaments are made up of actin molecules that interact with other strands of proteins. Metabolism All cells require energy to sustain cellular processes. Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions in an organism. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of metabolic wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or anabolic—the building up (synthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy.",
    "Enzymes also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells. Cellular respiration Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions. Sugar in the form of glucose is the main nutrient used by animal and plant cells in respiration. Cellular respiration involving oxygen is called aerobic respiration, which has four stages: glycolysis, citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle), electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the cytoplasm whereby glucose is converted into two pyruvates, with two net molecules of ATP being produced at the same time.",
    "Acetyl-Coa enters the citric acid cycle, which takes places inside the mitochondrial matrix. At the end of the cycle, the total yield from 1 glucose (or 2 pyruvates) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP molecules. Finally, the next stage is oxidative phosphorylation, which in eukaryotes, occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. Oxidative phosphorylation comprises the electron transport chain, which is a series of four protein complexes that transfer electrons from one complex to another, thereby releasing energy from NADH and FADH2 that is coupled to the pumping of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (chemiosmosis), which generates a proton motive force. Energy from the proton motive force drives the enzyme ATP synthase to synthesize more ATPs by phosphorylating ADPs. The transfer of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen being the final electron acceptor. If oxygen were not present, pyruvate would not be metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis.",
    "This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen. Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism's metabolic activities via cellular respiration. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. In most cases, oxygen is released as a waste product.",
    "Photosynthesis has four stages: Light absorption, electron transport, ATP synthesis, and carbon fixation. Light absorption is the initial step of photosynthesis whereby light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments attached to proteins in the thylakoid membranes. The absorbed light energy is used to remove electrons from a donor (water) to a primary electron acceptor, a quinone designated as Q. In the second stage, electrons move from the quinone primary electron acceptor through a series of electron carriers until they reach a final electron acceptor, which is usually the oxidized form of NADP+, which is reduced to NADPH, a process that takes place in a protein complex called photosystem I (PSI). The transport of electrons is coupled to the movement of protons (or hydrogen) from the stroma to the thylakoid membrane, which forms a pH gradient across the membrane as hydrogen becomes more concentrated in the lumen than in the stroma. This is analogous to the proton-motive force generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane in aerobic respiration. During the third stage of photosynthesis, the movement of protons down their concentration gradients from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma through the ATP synthase is coupled to the synthesis of ATP by that same ATP synthase.",
    "Cell signaling Cell signaling (or communication) is the ability of cells to receive, process, and transmit signals with its environment and with itself. Signals can be non-chemical such as light, electrical impulses, and heat, or chemical signals (or ligands) that interact with receptors, which can be found embedded in the cell membrane of another cell or located deep inside a cell. There are generally four types of chemical signals: autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and hormones. In autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it. Tumor cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division. In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them. For example, brain cells called neurons release ligands called neurotransmitters that diffuse across a synaptic cleft to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or muscle cell. In juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells. Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the circulatory systems of animals or vascular systems of plants to reach their target cells.",
    "Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor. For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an inotropic receptor can alter the excitability of a target cell. Other types of receptors include protein kinase receptors (e.g., receptor for the hormone insulin) and G protein-coupled receptors. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors can initiate second messenger cascades. The process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events is called signal transduction Cell cycle The cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell that cause it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the duplication of its DNA and some of its organelles, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotes (i.e., animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells), there are two distinct types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained.",
    "The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells. The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions. Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division (meiosis I), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division (meiosis II). Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Prokaryotes (i.e., archaea and bacteria) can also undergo cell division (or binary fission). Unlike the processes of mitosis and meiosis in eukaryotes, binary fission takes in prokaryotes takes place without the formation of a spindle apparatus on the cell. Before binary fission, DNA in the bacterium is tightly coiled. After it has uncoiled and duplicated, it is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases the size to prepare for splitting.",
    "The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA rods, ribosomes, and plasmids. Sexual reproduction and meiosis Meiosis is a central feature of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, and the most fundamental function of meiosis appears to be conservation of the integrity of the genome that is passed on to progeny by parents. Two aspects of sexual reproduction, meiotic recombination and outcrossing, are likely maintained respectively by the adaptive advantages of recombinational repair of genomic DNA damage and genetic complementation which masks the expression of deleterious recessive mutations. The beneficial effect of genetic complementation, derived from outcrossing (cross-fertilization) is also referred to as hybrid vigor or heterosis. Charles Darwin in his 1878 book The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilization in the Vegetable Kingdom at the start of chapter XII noted “The first and most important of the conclusions which may be drawn from the observations given in this volume, is that generally cross-fertilisation is beneficial and self-fertilisation often injurious, at least with the plants on which I experimented.” Genetic variation, often produced as a byproduct of sexual reproduction, may provide long-term advantages to those sexual lineages that engage in outcrossing.",
    "Mendelian inheritance, specifically, is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring. It has several principles. The first is that genetic characteristics, alleles, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs. white or tall vs. dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents. Based on the law of dominance and uniformity, which states that some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the phenotype of that dominant allele. During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. Heterozygotic individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles. Finally, the law of independent assortment, states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked. An exception to this rule would include traits that are sex-linked. Test crosses can be performed to experimentally determine the underlying genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype. A Punnett square can be used to predict the results of a test cross. The chromosome theory of inheritance, which states that genes are found on chromosomes, was supported by Thomas Morgans's experiments with fruit flies, which established the sex linkage between eye color and sex in these insects.",
    "DNA is composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. It is found as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes in a cell is collectively known as its genome. In eukaryotes, DNA is mainly in the cell nucleus. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within the nucleoid. The genetic information is held within genes, and the complete assemblage in an organism is called its genotype. DNA replication is a semiconservative process whereby each strand serves as a template for a new strand of DNA. Mutations are heritable changes in DNA. They can arise spontaneously as a result of replication errors that were not corrected by proofreading or can be induced by an environmental mutagen such as a chemical (e.g., nitrous acid, benzopyrene) or radiation (e.g., x-ray, gamma ray, ultraviolet radiation, particles emitted by unstable isotopes). Mutations can lead to phenotypic effects such as loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and conditional mutations. Some mutations are beneficial, as they are a source of genetic variation for evolution. Others are harmful if they were to result in a loss of function of genes needed for survival.",
    "This process is summarized by the central dogma of molecular biology, which was formulated by Francis Crick in 1958. According to the Central Dogma, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. There are two gene expression processes: transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein). Gene regulation The regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages of development can occur at each step of the process such as transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called transcription factors bind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter. A cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an operon, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans). In positive regulation of gene expression, the activator is the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds to the sequence near or at the promoter. Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a DNA sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur.",
    "In contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation. In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells. Genes, development, and evolution Development is the process by which a multicellular organism (plant or animal) goes through a series of changes, starting from a single cell, and taking on various forms that are characteristic of its life cycle. There are four key processes that underlie development: Determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth. Determination sets the developmental fate of a cell, which becomes more restrictive during development. Differentiation is the process by which specialized cells from less specialized cells such as stem cells. Stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can differentiate into various types of cells and proliferate indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell. Cellular differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals, which are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and epigenetics. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself.",
    "Morphogenesis, or the development of body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression. A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome called the developmental-genetic toolkit control the development of that organism. These toolkit genes are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva. Evolution Evolutionary processes Evolution is a central organizing concept in biology. It is the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations. In artificial selection, animals were selectively bred for specific traits. Given that traits are inherited, populations contain a varied mix of traits, and reproduction is able to increase any population, Darwin argued that in the natural world, it was nature that played the role of humans in selecting for specific traits. Darwin inferred that individuals who possessed heritable traits better adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other individuals.",
    "Speciation A species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other. For speciation to occur, there has to be reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model. Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with genetic divergence. Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as allopatric speciation. Phylogeny A phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes. It can be represented using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes. Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a lineage of descendants of a particular species or population. When a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic trees are the basis for comparing and grouping different species. Different species that share a feature inherited from a common ancestor are described as having homologous features (or synapomorphy). Phylogeny provides the basis of biological classification.",
    "All organisms can be classified as belonging to one of three domains: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); bacteria (originally eubacteria), or eukarya (includes the protist, fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms). History of life The history of life on Earth traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on Earth, both living and extinct, descended from a last universal common ancestor that lived about 3.5 billion years ago. Geologists have developed a geologic time scale that divides the history of the Earth into major divisions, starting with four eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic), the first three of which are collectively known as the Precambrian, which lasted approximately 4 billion years. Each eon can be divided into eras, with the Phanerozoic eon that began 539 million years ago being subdivided into Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras. These three eras together comprise eleven periods (Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary). The similarities among all known present-day species indicate that they have diverged through the process of evolution from their common ancestor. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as evidence of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes.",
    "The earliest evidence of eukaryotes dates from 1.85 billion years ago, and while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their metabolism. Later, around 1.7 billion years ago, multicellular organisms began to appear, with differentiated cells performing specialised functions. Algae-like multicellular land plants are dated back even to about 1 billion years ago, although evidence suggests that microorganisms formed the earliest terrestrial ecosystems, at least 2.7 billion years ago. Microorganisms are thought to have paved the way for the inception of land plants in the Ordovician period. Land plants were so successful that they are thought to have contributed to the Late Devonian extinction event. Ediacara biota appear during the Ediacaran period, while vertebrates, along with most other modern phyla originated about 525 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion. During the Permian period, synapsids, including the ancestors of mammals, dominated the land, but most of this group became extinct in the Permian–Triassic extinction event 252 million years ago.",
    "Cretaceous periods. After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed off the non-avian dinosaurs, mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity. Such mass extinctions may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify. Diversity Bacteria and Archaea Bacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometers in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of the Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory. Archaea constitute the other domain of prokaryotic cells and were initially classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), a term that has fallen out of use. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains, Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla.",
    "Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon, but unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria, no known species of Archaea form endospores. The first observed archaea were extremophiles, living in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes with no other organisms. Improved molecular detection tools led to the discovery of archaea in almost every habitat, including soil, oceans, and marshlands. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life. They are part of the microbiota of all organisms. In the human microbiome, they are important in the gut, mouth, and on the skin.",
    "Eukaryotes Eukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their endosymbioses with bacteria (or symbiogenesis) that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern-day eukaryotic cells. The major lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the Precambrian about 1.5 billion years ago and can be classified into eight major clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and animals. Five of these clades are collectively known as protists, which are mostly microscopic eukaryotic organisms that are not plants, fungi, or animals. While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor (the last eukaryotic common ancestor), protists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists. Like groupings such as algae, invertebrates, or protozoans, the protist grouping is not a formal taxonomic group but is used for convenience. Most protists are unicellular; these are called microbial eukaryotes. Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae, which would exclude fungi and some algae.",
    "The first several clades that emerged following primary endosymbiosis were aquatic and most of the aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms are collectively described as algae, which is a term of convenience as not all algae are closely related. Algae comprise several distinct clades such as glaucophytes, which are microscopic freshwater algae that may have resembled in form to the early unicellular ancestor of Plantae. Unlike glaucophytes, the other algal clades such as red and green algae are multicellular. Green algae comprise three major clades: chlorophytes, coleochaetophytes, and stoneworts. Fungi are eukaryotes that digest foods outside their bodies, secreting digestive enzymes that break down large food molecules before absorbing them through their cell membranes. Many fungi are also saprobes, feeding on dead organic matter, making them important decomposers in ecological systems. Animals are multicellular eukaryotes. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total."

    "Cells are the fundamental units of life, typically ranging in size from 1 to 100 micrometers, making them visible only under light or electron microscopes. There are two primary types of cells: eukaryotic and prokaryotic. \n\nEukaryotic cells possess a nucleus and can be either unicellular or multicellular organisms. In contrast, prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and are primarily represented by single-celled organisms such as bacteria. In multicellular organisms, all cells originate from a single fertilized egg cell.\n\n\nEach cell is enclosed by a cell membrane, which separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular environment. The cell membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer that includes cholesterol molecules interspersed among phospholipids, helping to maintain membrane fluidity across various temperatures. \n\nCell membranes are semipermeable, allowing the passage of small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water, while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles, such as ions. Additionally, cell membranes contain various membrane proteins. Integral membrane proteins span the membrane and function as transporters, while peripheral proteins are loosely attached to the outer surface of the membrane and often serve as enzymes, contributing to the cell's overall function and structure.",
    "The origins of science, including the field of medicine, can be traced back to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, approximately between 3000 and 1200 BCE. The contributions from these civilizations significantly influenced the development of natural philosophy in ancient Greece. Prominent Greek philosophers, such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE), made substantial advancements in biological knowledge by exploring biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor, Theophrastus, is recognized as the founder of the scientific study of plants.\n\nDuring the medieval period, scholars in the Islamic world made notable contributions to biology. Figures such as al-Jahiz (781–869) and Al-Dīnawarī (828–896) focused on various aspects of biology, including botany, while Rhazes (865–925) contributed to the understanding of anatomy and physiology. Islamic scholars, influenced by Greek philosophical traditions, extensively studied medicine, and their work in natural history was heavily informed by Aristotelian thought.\n\nThe field of biology experienced significant advancements with the improvements made to the microscope by Anton van Leeuwenhoek. His innovations led to the discovery of spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria, and a wide array of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam further stimulated interest in entomology and contributed to the development of techniques for microscopic dissection and staining. These advancements in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thought.\n\nBy the early 19th century, biologists began to emphasize the central importance of the cell, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of biological sciences.",
    "In the mid-19th century, Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow contributed significantly to the formulation of the third tenet of cell theory, which, by the 1860s, was widely accepted by biologists. This consolidation of ideas established the foundation of cell theory. Concurrently, taxonomy and classification emerged as primary areas of interest for natural historians.\n\nCarl Linnaeus published a foundational taxonomy of the natural world in 1735 and, in the 1750s, introduced a system of scientific nomenclature for species. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, viewed species as artificial constructs and proposed that living forms were adaptable, even suggesting the possibility of common descent among species.\n\nThe groundwork for evolutionary theory was laid by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who articulated a coherent framework for evolution. Subsequently, British naturalist Charles Darwin developed a more comprehensive theory of evolution through natural selection. His approach integrated the biogeographical insights of Alexander von Humboldt, the principles of uniformitarian geology proposed by Charles Lyell, and Thomas Malthus's observations on population growth, alongside his own extensive morphological studies and natural observations. Alfred Russel Wallace independently arrived at similar conclusions, reinforcing the concept of natural selection.\n\nThe principles of modern genetics were established by Gregor Mendel in 1865, laying the groundwork for understanding biological inheritance.",
    "Biology is the scientific study of life and encompasses a wide range of topics within the natural sciences. Despite its broad scope, biology is unified by several key themes that provide coherence to the field. \n\nOne fundamental concept is that all organisms are composed of cells, which process hereditary information encoded in genes. This genetic material can be transmitted to future generations, ensuring continuity of traits. Another central theme is evolution, which accounts for both the unity and diversity of life forms on Earth. \n\nEnergy processing is also crucial for life, as it enables organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Additionally, all living organisms possess the ability to regulate their internal environments, maintaining homeostasis in response to external changes.\n\nBiologists study life at various levels of organization, ranging from molecular biology, which examines cellular processes, to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, as well as the evolution of populations. This diversity of focus has led to the development of multiple subdisciplines within biology, each characterized by specific research questions and methodologies.\n\nLike other scientific disciplines, biology employs the scientific method, which involves making observations, formulating questions, generating hypotheses, conducting experiments, and drawing conclusions about the natural world.\n\nLife on Earth, which originated over 3.7 billion years ago, exhibits immense diversity. Biologists have dedicated their efforts to studying and classifying the myriad forms of life, including prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria, as well as eukaryotic organisms, which encompass protists, fungi, plants, and animals.",
    "In the 1940s and early 1950s, a series of pivotal experiments conducted by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase demonstrated that DNA is the component of chromosomes responsible for carrying genetic information, commonly referred to as genes. This period marked a significant shift in biological research, emphasizing new model organisms, particularly viruses and bacteria. The discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 further propelled the field into the era of molecular genetics.\n\nFrom the 1950s onward, advancements in molecular biology have greatly expanded our understanding of biological processes. The genetic code was elucidated by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley, and Marshall Warren Nirenberg, who revealed that DNA contains codons, the sequences that dictate the synthesis of proteins.\n\nIn 1990, the Human Genome Project was initiated with the objective of mapping the entire human genome, which has since provided invaluable insights into human genetics and disease.\n\n\nAll living organisms are composed of chemical elements, with oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen accounting for approximately 96% of their mass. The remaining elements, including calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium, make up the rest. These elements can combine to form essential compounds, such as water, which is vital for life.\n\nBiochemistry is the branch of science that explores the chemical processes within and related to living organisms, providing a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin biological functions.",
    "Functional groups are specific groups of atoms that contain elements such as oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S), which are bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton. In biological systems, six prominent functional groups are commonly recognized: the amino group, carboxyl group, carbonyl group, hydroxyl group, phosphate group, and sulfhydryl group.\n\nThe Miller–Urey experiment conducted in 1953 demonstrated that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically in a closed system that simulated the conditions of early Earth. This finding supports the hypothesis that complex organic molecules may have formed spontaneously during the early stages of Earth's development, a concept known as abiogenesis.\n\n\nMacromolecules are large molecules composed of smaller subunits known as monomers. Common types of monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides. \n\nCarbohydrates consist of both monomers and polymers of sugars. They serve as a primary energy source and play various roles in cellular structure and function. \n\nLipids represent a unique class of macromolecules that are not composed of polymers. This group includes steroids, phospholipids, and fats, which are primarily nonpolar and hydrophobic, meaning they repel water.\n\nProteins are regarded as the most diverse macromolecules, encompassing a wide range of functions. They include enzymes, transport proteins, signaling molecules, antibodies, and structural proteins. The fundamental unit of a protein is the amino acid, and there are twenty different amino acids that can be utilized in protein synthesis.\n\nNucleic acids, which include DNA and RNA, are polymers made up of nucleotides. Their primary functions are to store, transmit, and express hereditary information, playing a crucial role in the biology of all living organisms.",
    "The cytoplasm of a cell contains various biomolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. In eukaryotic cells, specialized structures known as organelles are present. These organelles are either surrounded by their own lipid bilayers or function as distinct spatial units within the cell.\n\nKey organelles include the cell nucleus, which houses the majority of the cell's DNA, and mitochondria, which are responsible for generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell. Other important organelles include the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein synthesis, and the Golgi apparatus, which plays a crucial role in the packaging and distribution of proteins.\n\nLysosomes, another specialized organelle, are responsible for engulfing and degrading biomolecules, including proteins. Plant cells possess additional organelles that differentiate them from animal cells. These include the cell wall, which provides structural support; chloroplasts, which capture sunlight to produce sugars through photosynthesis; and vacuoles, which serve multiple functions, including storage, structural support, and involvement in reproduction and seed breakdown.\n\nEukaryotic cells also contain a cytoskeleton composed of microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. This cytoskeletal network provides structural support to the cell and facilitates the movement of the cell and its organelles.",
    "Life on Earth originated in the planet's first oceans, which formed approximately 3.8 billion years ago. Water remains the most abundant molecule in all living organisms. Its significance to life stems from its role as an effective solvent, capable of dissolving various solutes, including sodium and chloride ions, as well as other small molecules. When these solutes dissolve in water, they are more likely to interact with one another, facilitating the chemical reactions essential for sustaining life.\n\nAt the molecular level, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape, resulting from the polar covalent bonds between two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom (H₂O). The polarity of the O–H bonds creates a slight negative charge on the oxygen atom and a slight positive charge on the hydrogen atoms. This polar characteristic enables water molecules to attract one another through hydrogen bonds, contributing to water's cohesive properties. \n\nThe cohesive forces among water molecules lead to surface tension, which is the result of the attraction between molecules at the liquid's surface. Additionally, water exhibits adhesive properties, allowing it to adhere to the surfaces of other polar or charged molecules.\n\nAnother unique property of water is its density; water is denser in its liquid state than in its solid state (ice). This characteristic enables ice to float on liquid water, such as in ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby providing insulation to the liquid water beneath from colder air above.",
    "Cell signaling, also known as cellular communication, refers to the processes by which cells receive, process, and transmit signals to and from their environment and among themselves. Signals can be categorized into non-chemical types, such as light, electrical impulses, and heat, as well as chemical signals, commonly referred to as ligands. These ligands interact with receptors, which may be located on the cell membrane or within the interior of a cell.\n\nChemical signals are generally classified into four main types: autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and hormones.\n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \nUnderstanding these signaling mechanisms is crucial for comprehending how cells interact and coordinate their functions within complex biological systems.",
    "Photosynthesis is a complex process that occurs in four main stages: light absorption, electron transport, ATP synthesis, and carbon fixation.\n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \nThrough these stages, photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy, supporting life on Earth by providing food and oxygen.",
    "Acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, which occurs within the mitochondrial matrix. The complete oxidation of one glucose molecule (or two pyruvate molecules) through this cycle yields a total of six NADH, two FADH2, and two ATP molecules.\n\nFollowing the citric acid cycle, the next stage of cellular respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the mitochondrial cristae in eukaryotic cells. This process involves the electron transport chain, a series of four protein complexes that facilitate the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2. As electrons move through these complexes, energy is released, which is utilized to pump protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton motive force through a process known as chemiosmosis.\n\nThe energy generated from the proton motive force drives the enzyme ATP synthase, enabling the synthesis of additional ATP by phosphorylating ADP. The electron transfer process concludes with molecular oxygen acting as the final electron acceptor. In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate cannot undergo cellular respiration and instead enters a fermentation pathway. During fermentation, pyruvate remains in the cytoplasm and is converted into waste products that can be expelled from the cell. This process serves to regenerate NAD+ from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue by providing the necessary electron carriers for ATP production.",
    "Enzymes play a crucial role in regulating the rate of metabolic reactions. They enable cells to respond to changes in their environment and to signals from other cells.\n\n\nCellular respiration encompasses a series of metabolic reactions and processes that occur within cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), while simultaneously releasing waste products. The reactions involved in cellular respiration are primarily catabolic, meaning they break down larger molecules into smaller ones, thereby releasing energy. This process is essential for cells to harness chemical energy to fuel various cellular activities.\n\nThe overall process of cellular respiration occurs through a sequence of biochemical steps, some of which involve redox reactions. Although cellular respiration can be classified as a combustion reaction, it differs significantly from typical combustion due to the slow and controlled release of energy throughout these reactions.\n\nIn both animal and plant cells, glucose serves as the primary nutrient utilized during cellular respiration. When oxygen is present, the process is referred to as aerobic respiration, which consists of four main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n\nGlycolysis is the initial metabolic pathway that occurs in the cytoplasm, where glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate. This process results in the net production of two ATP molecules, providing energy for the cell.",
    "Fermentation is a metabolic process that varies among different organisms, resulting in distinct waste products. In skeletal muscles, the primary waste product is lactic acid, produced during a process known as lactic acid fermentation. This occurs during strenuous exercise when energy demands surpass the available energy supply. Under these conditions, the respiratory chain is unable to process all hydrogen atoms associated with NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ is regenerated when pairs of hydrogen atoms combine with pyruvate to form lactate. This reaction is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase and is reversible. Lactate can also serve as an indirect precursor for glycogen synthesis in the liver. Upon recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ reattaches to hydrogen from lactate, facilitating the production of ATP.\n\nIn yeast, the waste products of fermentation are ethanol and carbon dioxide, a process referred to as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process occurs through substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen.\n\n\nPhotosynthesis is a process utilized by plants and certain other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy, which can subsequently be released to support metabolic activities through cellular respiration. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. Typically, oxygen is released as a byproduct of this process.",
    "Microfilaments are cytoskeletal structures composed primarily of actin molecules. These actin filaments interact with various proteins, contributing to numerous cellular functions, including maintaining cell shape, enabling motility, and facilitating intracellular transport.\n\nMetabolism encompasses the entirety of chemical reactions occurring within an organism. It is essential for sustaining cellular processes and can be divided into two primary categories: catabolism and anabolism.\n\n1. \n2. \nThe overall functions of metabolism can be summarized as follows:\n- The conversion of food into energy to power cellular activities.\n- The transformation of food and fuel into monomer building blocks necessary for growth and repair.\n- The removal of metabolic waste products.\n\nMetabolic reactions are organized into metabolic pathways, where one chemical is transformed into another through a series of enzymatically facilitated steps. Enzymes play a critical role in metabolism by enabling reactions that would not occur spontaneously. They achieve this by coupling energy-releasing reactions with energy-requiring processes, thereby driving essential biological functions.\n\nIn summary, metabolism is vital for growth, reproduction, structural maintenance, and environmental responsiveness, underscoring its importance in the life of an organism.",
    "Mitosis is a critical phase of the cell cycle in animal cells, characterized by the division of a single mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells. This process is essential for growth, development, and tissue repair in multicellular organisms. The cell cycle encompasses various stages, including interphase, during which the cell prepares for division.\n\nIn contrast to mitosis, meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that results in four haploid daughter cells. Meiosis involves one round of DNA replication followed by two distinct divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are separated, while sister chromatids are separated during meiosis II. Both mitosis and meiosis play significant roles in sexual reproduction and are believed to have originated in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes.\n\nProkaryotes, such as archaea and bacteria, also undergo cell division, primarily through a process known as binary fission. Unlike mitosis and meiosis, binary fission does not involve the formation of a spindle apparatus. Prior to division, the DNA within a prokaryotic cell is tightly coiled. Following uncoiling and replication, the DNA is segregated to opposite poles of the cell as it enlarges in preparation for division.\n\nUnderstanding these processes is fundamental to the study of biology, as they are integral to the life cycles of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms.",
    "The newly formed daughter cells contain tightly coiled DNA, ribosomes, and plasmids. \n\n\nMeiosis is a fundamental process in sexual reproduction among eukaryotes, primarily serving to preserve the integrity of the genome that is transmitted from parents to offspring. Two key components of sexual reproduction—meiotic recombination and outcrossing—are believed to be maintained due to their adaptive advantages. Meiotic recombination facilitates the repair of genomic DNA damage, while outcrossing enhances genetic complementation, which can mask the expression of harmful recessive mutations.\n\nThe beneficial effects of genetic complementation arising from outcrossing, also known as hybrid vigor or heterosis, contribute to the overall fitness of a population. Charles Darwin, in his 1878 work \nAdditionally, genetic variation, which often results from sexual reproduction, may provide long-term advantages to lineages that engage in outcrossing, enhancing their adaptability and survival.",
    "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix structure. In eukaryotic organisms, DNA is organized into linear chromosomes, whereas in prokaryotic organisms, it exists as circular chromosomes. The complete set of chromosomes within a cell is referred to as its genome.\n\nIn eukaryotes, DNA is primarily located in the cell nucleus, while in prokaryotes, it is found in a region called the nucleoid. Genetic information is encoded within segments of DNA known as genes, and the entire collection of genes in an organism constitutes its genotype.\n\nDNA replication is a semiconservative process, meaning that each original strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. Mutations, which are heritable changes in the DNA sequence, can occur spontaneously due to errors during replication that are not corrected by proofreading mechanisms. Additionally, mutations can be induced by environmental factors, including chemical agents (such as nitrous acid and benzopyrene) and various forms of radiation (including X-rays, gamma rays, and ultraviolet radiation).\n\nMutations can result in a range of phenotypic effects, including loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and conditional mutations. While some mutations may be detrimental, leading to the loss of essential gene functions necessary for survival, others can be beneficial, contributing to genetic variation and the process of evolution.",
    "Mendelian inheritance refers to the principles governing the transmission of genetic traits from parents to offspring. This process is based on several key principles established by Gregor Mendel through his experiments with pea plants.\n\nOne fundamental principle is that genetic characteristics, known as alleles, exist in discrete forms. For example, traits such as flower color can be represented by alleles for purple or white flowers, while plant height can be represented by alleles for tall or dwarf plants. Each offspring inherits one allele from each parent.\n\nAccording to the law of dominance, some alleles are dominant, while others are recessive. An organism possessing at least one dominant allele will exhibit the phenotype associated with that dominant allele. During the formation of gametes, the alleles for each gene segregate, ensuring that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. In heterozygous individuals, gametes are produced with equal frequencies of the two alleles.\n\nThe law of independent assortment states that genes for different traits segregate independently during gamete formation, indicating that these genes are unlinked. However, exceptions exist, such as traits that are sex-linked.\n\nTo experimentally determine the genotype of an organism exhibiting a dominant phenotype, researchers can conduct test crosses. A Punnett square is often employed to predict the outcomes of these crosses.\n\nThe chromosome theory of inheritance posits that genes are located on chromosomes. This theory was supported by the experiments of Thomas Morgan, who studied fruit flies and demonstrated the sex linkage between eye color and sex in these organisms.",
    "When a ligand binds to a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the receptor type. For example, neurotransmitters that interact with ionotropic receptors can modify the excitability of target cells. Other receptor types include protein kinase receptors, such as the insulin receptor, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The activation of GPCRs can initiate cascades involving second messengers, which play a crucial role in cellular signaling.\n\n\nThe process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell, involving a series of molecular events, is known as signal transduction.\n\n\nThe cell cycle is a sequence of events that occur in a cell, leading to its division into two daughter cells. This process includes the duplication of DNA and certain organelles, followed by the partitioning of the cytoplasm in a process known as cell division. In eukaryotic organisms—such as animals, plants, fungi, and protists—there are two primary types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. \n\nMitosis is a phase of the cell cycle during which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei, resulting in the formation of genetically identical cells, with the total number of chromosomes maintained.",
    "Morphogenesis, the process by which organisms develop their body forms, results from spatial differences in gene expression. A subset of genes within an organism's genome, known as the developmental-genetic toolkit, plays a crucial role in this development. These toolkit genes are highly conserved across various phyla, indicating their ancient origins and similarity among diverse animal groups. Variations in the expression and deployment of these toolkit genes influence the body plan, as well as the number, identity, and arrangement of body parts.\n\nAmong the most significant of these toolkit genes are the Hox genes. Hox genes are essential in determining the locations of repeating structures, such as the vertebrae in snakes, during the development of embryos or larvae.\n\n\nEvolution is a fundamental concept in biology, defined as the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations. One form of evolution is artificial selection, where humans selectively breed animals for specific traits. Since traits are inherited, populations exhibit a diverse array of characteristics. Charles Darwin proposed that in natural environments, nature itself acts as the selector for advantageous traits. He posited that individuals with heritable traits better suited to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing those traits to subsequent generations.",
    "A species is defined as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Speciation is the evolutionary process through which a single lineage diverges into two distinct lineages, resulting from independent evolutionary paths. For speciation to occur, reproductive isolation is essential. This isolation can arise from genetic incompatibilities, as explained by the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model. Additionally, reproductive isolation tends to increase with genetic divergence.\n\nSpeciation can occur through various mechanisms, one of which is allopatric speciation. This process takes place when physical barriers, such as mountains or rivers, separate an ancestral species, leading to the development of distinct populations over time.\n\n\nPhylogeny refers to the evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes. It is often illustrated using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram that depicts the lines of descent among organisms or their genetic material. Each line on the time axis of a phylogenetic tree represents a lineage descended from a particular species or population. When a lineage splits into two, this is represented as a fork or split on the tree.\n\nPhylogenetic trees serve as a foundational tool for comparing and categorizing different species. Species that share characteristics inherited from a common ancestor are described as having homologous features, also known as synapomorphies. Understanding phylogeny is crucial for biological classification and provides insight into the evolutionary relationships among various organisms.",
    "The earliest evidence of eukaryotic life dates back approximately 1.85 billion years. While it is possible that eukaryotes existed prior to this, their diversification is believed to have accelerated with the advent of oxygen-utilizing metabolic processes. Around 1.7 billion years ago, multicellular organisms began to emerge, featuring differentiated cells that performed specialized functions.\n\nAlgae-like multicellular land plants are estimated to have appeared around 1 billion years ago. However, evidence indicates that microorganisms were the foundation of the earliest terrestrial ecosystems, existing at least 2.7 billion years ago. These microorganisms are thought to have facilitated the emergence of land plants during the Ordovician period. The success of land plants is significant, as they are believed to have played a role in the Late Devonian extinction event.\n\nThe Ediacara biota emerged during the Ediacaran period, marking a notable point in the history of life. Most modern phyla, including vertebrates, originated approximately 525 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion. Throughout the Permian period, synapsids, which include the ancestors of mammals, were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates. However, the majority of this group faced extinction during the Permian–Triassic extinction event, which occurred around 252 million years ago.",
    "The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago, resulted in the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This event allowed mammals to rapidly increase in size and diversity. Mass extinctions can accelerate evolutionary processes by creating opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify and thrive.\n\n\n\nBacteria are a major domain of prokaryotic microorganisms, typically measuring a few micrometers in length. They exhibit a variety of shapes, including spheres, rods, and spirals. Bacteria are among the earliest life forms on Earth and can be found in diverse habitats, including soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of the Earth's crust. They also engage in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. \n\nDespite their prevalence, most bacterial species remain uncharacterized, with only about 27 percent of known bacterial phyla containing species that can be cultivated in laboratory settings.\n\nArchaea represent another domain of prokaryotic cells. Initially classified as bacteria under the term \"archaebacteria,\" this designation has become outdated. Archaeal cells possess distinct characteristics that differentiate them from both Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are further categorized into several recognized phyla, highlighting their diversity and unique evolutionary lineage.",
    "All organisms are classified into one of three domains: Archaea (formerly known as Archaebacteria), Bacteria (previously referred to as Eubacteria), and Eukarya, which encompasses the kingdoms of Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.\n\n\nThe history of life on Earth outlines the evolutionary journey of organisms from the earliest forms of life to the present day. Earth formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, and all life, both extant and extinct, is believed to have descended from a last universal common ancestor that existed around 3.5 billion years ago.\n\nGeologists have established a geologic time scale that segments Earth's history into major divisions, beginning with four eons: Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic. The first three eons are collectively referred to as the Precambrian, which spanned nearly 4 billion years. Each eon can be further divided into eras. The Phanerozoic eon, which commenced 539 million years ago, is subdivided into three eras: Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. These eras are further categorized into eleven periods: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary.\n\nThe similarities observed among all known present-day species suggest that they have diverged through the process of evolution from their common ancestor. Biologists consider the universality of the genetic code as evidence supporting the concept of universal common descent for all organisms within the domains of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.",
    "The central dogma of molecular biology, formulated by Francis Crick in 1958, describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. According to this framework, genetic information is transferred from DNA to RNA and then to protein. This process involves two primary mechanisms: transcription and translation.\n\n\n1. 2. \n\nGene expression is regulated by various environmental factors and developmental stages, and this regulation can occur at multiple points in the process, including transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of proteins. \n\nGene expression can be influenced by two types of regulatory mechanisms: positive regulation and negative regulation.\n\n-   \n- \n\nAn operon is a cluster of genes that share a common promoter and are typically found in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes, such as \nRepressors can be inhibited by molecules known as inducers (for example, allolactose), which allow transcription to proceed by preventing the repressor from binding to the operator.\n\nThis intricate system of gene regulation ensures that genes are expressed at the right time and in the right amounts, allowing for proper cellular function and response to environmental changes.",
    "Structural genes are responsible for encoding proteins that do not play a role in gene regulation. Gene expression can be regulated through various mechanisms, including regulatory events associated with the promoter region and epigenetic modifications to chromatin. Chromatin is a complex of DNA and proteins found in eukaryotic cells that can influence gene activity without altering the underlying DNA sequence.\n\n\nDevelopment refers to the series of changes that a multicellular organism, whether plant or animal, undergoes from a single cell to various forms characteristic of its life cycle. Four essential processes underpin development: determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth.\n\n1.    \n2. \n3. \n4. \nCellular differentiation leads to significant changes in a cell's size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals. These changes are primarily driven by tightly regulated modifications in gene expression and epigenetic factors. Notably, with few exceptions, cellular differentiation does not involve alterations to the DNA sequence itself.",
    "Eukaryotes are believed to have diverged from archaea, followed by endosymbiotic events with bacteria that led to the formation of mitochondria and chloroplasts. These organelles are now integral components of modern eukaryotic cells. The major lineages of eukaryotes began to diversify during the Precambrian period, approximately 1.5 billion years ago. Eukaryotes can be classified into eight primary clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and animals.\n\nFive of these clades are grouped together as protists, which primarily consist of microscopic eukaryotic organisms that do not fall under the categories of plants, fungi, or animals. While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor, known as the last eukaryotic common ancestor, they do not form a distinct clade. Some protists may be more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than to other protists. Consequently, the term \"protist\" serves as a convenient classification rather than a formal taxonomic group, similar to terms like algae, invertebrates, or protozoans.\n\nMost protists are unicellular and are referred to as microbial eukaryotes. In contrast, plants are primarily multicellular organisms that belong to the kingdom Plantae, which includes predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes while excluding fungi and certain algae.",
    "Biodiversity plays a crucial role in the functioning of ecosystems, which provide a wide range of services essential for human well-being. Conservation biologists study the trends associated with biodiversity loss and species extinctions, highlighting the adverse effects these phenomena have on the ability to sustain human societies.\n\nIn response to the ongoing biodiversity crisis, various organizations and individuals are implementing conservation action plans. These initiatives focus on directing research, monitoring, and educational programs that address concerns at both local and global levels. Through these efforts, stakeholders aim to enhance understanding and promote strategies for preserving biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services.",
    "Archaeal biochemistry features distinctive traits, such as the presence of ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea exhibit a broader range of energy sources compared to eukaryotes, utilizing organic compounds like sugars, as well as inorganic substances such as ammonia, metal ions, and hydrogen gas. Among the salt-tolerant archaea, known as Haloarchaea, some species harness sunlight as an energy source, while others are capable of carbon fixation. However, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea can perform both functions simultaneously.\n\nReproduction in archaea occurs asexually through methods such as binary fission, fragmentation, or budding. Notably, unlike bacteria, no known species of archaea produce endospores. The initial discoveries of archaea were primarily of extremophiles, organisms thriving in extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes devoid of other life forms. \n\nAdvancements in molecular detection techniques have revealed the presence of archaea in diverse habitats, including soil, oceans, and marshlands. They are particularly abundant in marine environments, with archaeal populations in plankton representing one of the most prevalent groups of organisms on Earth. \n\nArchaea play a significant role in the biosphere and are integral components of the microbiota associated with various organisms. In the human microbiome, archaea are notably present in the gut, mouth, and skin, contributing to the overall microbial diversity and functionality.",
    "Ecological interactions can be categorized as either short-term or long-term, both of which significantly influence the evolution of the species involved. Long-term interactions are referred to as symbiosis, which encompasses a range of relationships from mutualism, where both partners benefit, to competition, which can be detrimental to both.\n\nEvery species engages in consumer-resource interactions, which are fundamental to the structure of food chains and food webs. Within any food web, there are various trophic levels. The lowest level consists of primary producers, also known as autotrophs, such as plants and algae. These organisms convert energy and inorganic materials into organic compounds, serving as a vital resource for the rest of the community.\n\nThe next level comprises heterotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down organic compounds from other organisms. Heterotrophs that consume plants are classified as primary consumers or herbivores. Those that feed on herbivores are termed secondary consumers or carnivores. Additionally, organisms that prey on secondary consumers are known as tertiary consumers, and this pattern continues through subsequent levels. Omnivorous heterotrophs have the ability to feed at multiple trophic levels.\n\nFinally, decomposers play a crucial role in the ecosystem by breaking down waste products and the remains of dead organisms, thus recycling nutrients back into the environment."
