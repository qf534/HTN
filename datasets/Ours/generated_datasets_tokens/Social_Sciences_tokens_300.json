    "An economy is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services. In general, it is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources. A given economy is a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain. Economic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital. It has changed over time due to technology, innovation (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) and changes in industrial relations (most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education).",
    "The Latin word has its origin at the Ancient Greek's oikonomia or oikonomos. The word's first part oikos means \"house\", and the second part nemein means \"to manage\". The most frequently used current sense, denoting \"the economic system of a country or an area\", seems not to have developed until the 1650s. History Earliest roots As long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. Sumer developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money, while the Babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on debt, legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property. The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The ancient economy was based primarily on subsistence farming. The Shekel are the first to refer to a unit of weight and currency, used by the Semitic peoples. The first usage of the term came from Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC.",
    "A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of currency and a unit of weight, just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one-pound mass of silver. Most exchange of goods had occurred through social relationships. There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. In Ancient Greece, where the present English word 'economy' originated, many people were bond slaves of the freeholders. The economic discussion was driven by scarcity. In Chinese economic law, the huge cycle of institutional innovation contains an idea. Serving a non-market economy promotes a firm's tenure that is legally guaranteed and protected from bureaucratic opportunities. Middle Ages In the Middle Ages, what is now known as an economy was not far from the subsistence level. Most exchange occurred within social groups. On top of this, the great conquerors raised what we now call venture capital (from ventura, ital.; risk) to finance their captures. The capital should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the New World. The discoveries of Marco Polo (1254–1324), Christopher Columbus (1451–1506) and Vasco da Gama (1469–1524) led to a first global economy. The first enterprises were trading establishments. In 1513, the first stock exchange was founded in Antwerp. Economy at the time meant primarily trade. The European captures became branches of the European states, the so-called colonies.",
    "France, Great Britain and the Netherlands tried to control the trade through custom duties and mercantilism (from mercator, lat.: merchant) was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and public interest. The secularization in Europe allowed states to use the immense property of the church for the development of towns. The influence of the nobles decreased. The first Secretaries of State for economy started their work. Bankers like Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773–1855) started to finance national projects such as wars and infrastructure. Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the citizens of a state. Industrial Revolution The first economist in the true modern meaning of the word was the Scotsman Adam Smith (1723–1790) who was inspired partly by the ideas of physiocracy, a reaction to mercantilism and also later Economics student, Adam Mari. He defined the elements of a national economy: products are offered at a natural price generated by the use of competition - supply and demand - and the division of labor. He maintained that the basic motive for free trade is human self-interest. The so-called self-interest hypothesis became the anthropological basis for economics. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of overpopulation.",
    "The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way. In Europe wild capitalism started to replace the system of mercantilism (today: protectionism) and led to economic growth. The period today is called industrial revolution because the system of Production, production and division of labor enabled the mass production of goods. 20th century The contemporary concept of \"the economy\" wasn't popularly known until the American Great Depression in the 1930s. After the chaos of two World Wars and the devastating Great Depression, policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy. This was explored and discussed by Friedrich August von Hayek (1899–1992) and Milton Friedman (1912–2006) who pleaded for a global free trade and are supposed to be the fathers of the so-called neoliberalism. However, the prevailing view was that held by John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), who argued for a stronger control of the markets by the state. The theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called Keynesianism in his honor.",
    "Wirtschaftswunder (German for economic miracle) —brought up a new form of economy: mass consumption economy. In 1958, John Kenneth Galbraith (1908–2006) was the first to speak of an affluent society in his book The Affluent Society. In most of the countries the economic system is called a social market economy. 21st century With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Bloc towards democratic government and market economies, the idea of the post-industrial society is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the service sector receives instead of industrialization. Some attribute the first use of this term to Daniel Bell's 1973 book, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, while others attribute it to social philosopher Ivan Illich's book, Tools for Conviviality. The term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of postmodernism in the late 90s and especially in the beginning of the 21st century. With the spread of Internet as a mass media and communication medium especially after 2000–2001, the idea for the Internet and information economy is given place because of the growing importance of e-commerce and electronic businesses, also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type of \"all-connected\" society is created.",
    "Elements Types A market economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants (economic agents) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency. A planned economy is one where political agents directly control what is produced and how it is sold and distributed. A green economy is low-carbon and resource efficient. In a green economy, growth in income and employment is driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance energy and resource efficiency, and prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. A gig economy is one in which short-term jobs are assigned or chosen on-demand. The global economy refers to humanity's economic system or systems overall. An informal economy is neither taxed nor monitored by any form of government. Sectors The economy may be considered as having developed through the following phases or degrees of precedence: The ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farming. The industrial revolution phase lessened the role of subsistence farming, converting it to more extensive and mono-cultural forms of agriculture in the last three centuries. The economic growth took place mostly in mining, construction and manufacturing industries.",
    "In the economies of modern consumer societies phase there is a growing part played by services, finance, and technology—the knowledge economy. In modern economies, these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by the three-sector model: Primary: Involves the extraction and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron. Secondary: Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. Tertiary: Involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses, such as baby-sitting, cinema and banking. Other sectors of the developed community include: the public sector or state sector (which usually includes: parliament, law-courts and government centers, various emergency services, public health, shelters for impoverished and threatened people, transport facilities, air/sea ports, post-natal care, hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, preserved historical buildings, parks/gardens, nature-reserves, some universities, national sports grounds/stadiums, national arts/concert-halls or theaters and centers for various religions). the private sector or privately run businesses. the voluntary sector or social sector.",
    "The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and GDP per capita. While often useful, GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged. Due to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times, the term real economy is used by analysts as well as politicians to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with the actual production of goods and services, as ostensibly contrasted with the paper economy, or the financial side of the economy, which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets. Alternate and long-standing terminology distinguishes measures of an economy expressed in real values (adjusted for inflation), such as real GDP, or in nominal values (unadjusted for inflation). Studies The study of economics are roughly divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics. Today, the range of fields of study examining the economy revolves around the social science of economics, but may also include sociology, history, anthropology, and geography. Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services as a whole are business, engineering, government, and health care. Macroeconomics is studied at the regional and national levels, and common analyses include income and production, money, prices, employment, international trade, and other issues.",

    "In planning, the evening economy describes economic activity taking place in the evening after many people finish daytime employment or formal education, such as eating and drinking, entertainment, and nightlife (which may be described by the related term nighttime economy). Activities The evening economy includes, but is not limited to: Eating out - restaurants, cafes, takeaways Drinking - pubs and bars Culture and entertainment - theatres, cinemas, live music and comedy events, ten pin bowling, ice skating Sport - spectator sports including football, rugby and greyhound racing often take place in the evening, especially during Mondays to Fridays. Healthcare, police and firefighting Benefits and drawbacks The benefits of a significant evening economy can include: Recreation for people, which is often welcome after finishing work for the day Increased employment due to local spending Reduced social exclusion and increased vitality in towns The drawbacks can include: Noise pollution Crime and/or anti-social behaviour, particularly where alcohol is involved Traffic congestion Regeneration Evening economic activity has been used to drive urban regeneration in cities such as Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and Dublin.",
    "The New Economy refers to the ongoing development of the American economic system. It evolved from the notions of the classical economy via the transition from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy, and has been driven by new technology and innovations. This popular use of the term emerged during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where high growth, low inflation, and high employment of this period led to optimistic predictions and flawed business plans. Origins A 1983 cover article in Time, \"The New Economy\", described the transition from heavy industry to a new technology based economy. By 1997, Newsweek was referring to the \"new economy\" in many of its articles. After a nearly 25-year period of unprecedented growth, the United States experienced a much discussed economic slowdown beginning in 1972. However, around 1995, U.S. economic growth accelerated, driven by faster productivity growth. From 1972 to 1995, the growth rate of output per hour, a measure of labor productivity, had only averaged around one-percent per year. But by the mid 1990s, growth became much faster: 2.65 percent from 1995–99. America also experienced increased employment and decreasing inflation. The economist Robert J.",
    "Gordon contended in 2000, that the benefits of computers were marginal or even negative for the majority of firms, with their benefits being consolidated in the computer hardware and durable goods manufacturing sectors, which only represent a relatively small segment of the economy. His method relied on applying considerably sized gains in the business cycle to explain aggregate productivity growth. According to the generally unaccepted Kondratiev wave theory of economy growth, the \"new economy\" is a current Kondratiev wave which will end after a 50-year period in the 2040s. Its innovative basis includes Internet, nanotechnologies, telematics and bionics. Dot-coms In the financial markets, the term has been associated with the Dot-com bubble. This included the emergence of the NASDAQ as a rival to the New York Stock Exchange, a high rate of IPOs, the rise of Dot-com stocks over established firms, and the prevalent use of tools such as stock options. In the wider economy the term has been associated with practices such as outsourcing, business process outsourcing and business process re-engineering. At the same time, there was a lot of investment in companies in the technology sector. Stock shares rose dramatically. A lot of start-ups were created and the stock value was very high where floated.",
    "Some even claimed that the old laws of economics did not apply anymore and that new laws had taken their place. They also claimed that improvements in computer hardware and software would dramatically change the future, and that information is the most important value in the new economy. Some, such as Joseph Stiglitz and Blake Belding, have suggested that a lot of investment in information technology, especially in software and unused fibre optics, was useless. However, this may be too harsh a judgment, given that U.S. investment in information technology has remained relatively strong since 2002. While there may have been some overinvestment, productivity research shows that much of the investment has been useful in raising output. The recession of 2001 disproved many of the more extreme predictions made during the boom years, and gave credence to Gordon's minimization of computers' contributions. However, subsequent research strongly suggests that productivity growth has been stimulated by heavy investment in information and communication technology.",
    "The new manufacturing economy (NME) describes the role of advanced manufacturing in the rise of the New Economy. The term describes manufacturing enabled by digital technologies, advanced systems and processes and a highly trained and knowledgeable workforce. The new manufacturing economy integrates networks, 3D printers and other proficiencies into business strategies to further develop manufacturing practices. Thomas Friedman references Lawrence F. Katz that hubs of \"universities, high-tech manufacturers, software/service providers and highly nimble start-ups\" are a needed economic development strategy. This is very similar to NME thoughts even though that exact term is not used. The Pillars of the new manufacturing economy Technology Focus on geographic expansion, information technology and internet commerce are on the rise for industrial manufacturing companies according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers Q4 2010 Manufacturing Barometer. Such conditions compel companies to incorporate new technologies into business plans and to concentrate on the application of open-source product development in the creation of physical goods as a form of competitive advantage. New technologies influence various industries to emphasize innovation as a business tool.",
    "In theoretical economics, an abstract economy (also called a generalized N-person game) is a model that generalizes both the standard model of an exchange economy in microeconomics, and the standard model of a game in game theory. An equilibrium in an abstract economy generalizes both a Walrasian equilibrium in microeconomics, and a Nash equilibrium in game-theory. The concept was introduced by Gérard Debreu in 1952. He named it generalized N-person game, and proved the existence of equilibrium in this game. Later, Debreu and Kenneth Arrow (who renamed the concept to abstract economy) used this existence result to prove the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium (aka competitive equilibrium) in the Arrow–Debreu model. Later, Shafer and Sonnenschein extended both theorems to irrational agents - agents with non-transitive and non-complete preferences. Abstract economy with utility functions The general case Definition In the model of Debreu, an abstract economy contains a finite number N of agents. For each agent i {\\displaystyle i}, there is: A choice-set X i {\\displaystyle X_{i}} (a subset of some Euclidean space R l {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{l}} ). This represents the global set of choices that the agent can make. We define the cartesian product of all choice sets as: X := ∏ j = 1 N X j",
    "A utility function: U i : X → R {\\displaystyle U_{i}:X\\to \\mathbb {R} }, representing the utility that the agent receives from each combination of choices. The goal of each agent is to choose an action that maximizes his utility. Equilibrium An equilibrium in an abstract economy is a vector of choices, x = ( x 1, …, x N ) = ( x i, x − i ) {\\displaystyle x=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{N})=(x_{i},x_{-i})}, such that, for each agent i {\\displaystyle i}, the action x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} maximizes the function U i ( ⋅, x − i ) {\\displaystyle U_{i}(\\cdot,x_{-i})} subject to the constraint x i ∈ A i ( x ) {\\displaystyle x_{i}\\in A_{i}(x)} : U i ( x i, x − i ) = max x i ′ ∈ A i ( x ) U i ( x i ′, x − i ) {\\displaystyle U_{i}(x_{i},x_{-i})=\\max _{x_{i}'\\in A_{i}(x)}U_{i}(x_{i}',x_{-i})} Equivalently, for each agent",
    "Another weakening, which does not use graph-continuity, is: Each utility function U i {\\displaystyle U_{i}} is quasi-concave in x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}}, upper semi-continuous in x {\\displaystyle x}, and the function W i ( x − i ) := max x i U i ( x i, x − i ) {\\displaystyle W_{i}(x_{-i}):=\\max _{x_{i}}U_{i}(x_{i},x_{-i})} [which is defined since U i {\\displaystyle U_{i}} is upper semi-continuous] is lower semi-continuous. The proofs use the Kakutani fixed point theorem. Exchange economy as a special case Definition An exchange economy is a system with N-1 consumers and l {\\displaystyle l} homogeneous divisible goods. For each consumer i, there is: A consumption-set Y i {\\displaystyle Y_{i}} (a subset of R l {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{l}} ). This represents the set of bundles that the agent can consume. We define the cartesian product of all consumption sets as: Y := ∏ j = 1 N Y j {\\displaystyle Y:=\\prod _{j=1}^{N}Y_{j}}. An initial endowment vector w i ∈ R + l.",
    "Equilibrium A Walrasian equilibrium (aka competitive equilibrium) in an exchange economy is a vector of consumption-bundles and a price-vector, ( y 1, …, y N − 1, p ) {\\displaystyle (y_{1},\\ldots,y_{N-1},p)}, such that: The total consumption is at most the total endowment: ∑ y i ≤ ∑ w i {\\displaystyle \\sum y_{i}\\leq \\sum w_{i}}. The total expense of each agent is at most his budget: p ⋅ y i ≤ p ⋅ w i {\\displaystyle p\\cdot y_{i}\\leq p\\cdot w_{i}}. For each agent i {\\displaystyle i}, the consumption y i {\\displaystyle y_{i}} maximizes the function V i ( ⋅ ) {\\displaystyle V_{i}(\\cdot )} subject to the constraint p ⋅ y i ≤ p ⋅ w i {\\displaystyle p\\cdot y_{i}\\leq p\\cdot w_{i}}. I.e, if V i ( z ) > V i ( y i ) {\\displaystyle V_{i}(z)>V_{i}(y_{i})}, then p ⋅ z > p ⋅ w i ≥ p ⋅ y i {\\displaystyle p",
    "The market player has a choice set X N := Δ {\\displaystyle X_{N}:=\\Delta } (the set of possible price-vectors), utility function U N ( y, p ) := p ⋅ ( ∑ y i − ∑ w i ) {\\displaystyle U_{N}(y,p):=p\\cdot (\\sum y_{i}-\\sum w_{i})}, and action set defined by A N ( y, p ) ≡ Δ {\\displaystyle A_{N}(y,p)\\equiv \\Delta }. Intuitively, the market player chooses the price in a way that balances supply and demand: for commodities with more supply than demand, the right-hand term in U N ( y, p ) {\\displaystyle U_{N}(y,p)} is negative so the market player chooses a low price; for commodities with more demand than supply, the term is positive so the market player chooses a high price. The following conditions in the exchange economy are sufficient to guarantee that the abstract economy satisfies the conditions for equilibrium: Each consumption-set Y i {\\displaystyle Y_{i}} is compact and convex, and contains the endowment w i {\\displaystyle w_{i}} in its interior. Each utility function V i {\\displaystyle V_{i}} is continuous and quasi-concave.",
    "For example, it is sufficient to assume that all agents are not satiated. The definition A i ( y, p ) = { y i ∈ Y i | p y i ≤ p w i } {\\displaystyle A_{i}(y,p)=\\{y_{i}\\in Y_{i}|py_{i}\\leq pw_{i}\\}} guarantees that the total expense of each agent is at most his budget. The definition U i = V i {\\displaystyle U_{i}=V_{i}} guarantees that the consumption of each agent maximizes his utility given the budget. And the definition U N ( y, p ) := p ⋅ ( ∑ y i − ∑ w i ) {\\displaystyle U_{N}(y,p):=p\\cdot (\\sum y_{i}-\\sum w_{i})} guarantees that the total consumption equals the total endowment. Therefore, if the exchange economy satisfies the above three conditions, a competitive equilibrium exists. In the proof we assumed that V i {\\displaystyle V_{i}} depends only on y i {\\displaystyle y_{i}}, but this assumption is not really needed: the proof remains valid even if the utility depends on the consumptions of other agents (externalities), or on the prices. Abstract economy with preference correspondences The general case Definition In the generalized model of Shafer and Sonnenschein, For each",
    "The model of Debreu is a special case of this model, in which the preference correspondences are defined based on utility functions: P i ( x ) := { z i ∈ X i : U i ( z i, x − i ) > U i ( x i, x − i ) } {\\displaystyle P_{i}(x):=\\{z_{i}\\in X_{i}:U_{i}(z_{i},x_{-i})>U_{i}(x_{i},x_{-i})\\}}. However, the generalized model does not require that the preference-correspondence can be represented by a utility function. In particular, it does not have to correspond to a transitive relation. Equilibrium An equilibrium in a generalized abstract economy is a vector of choices, x = ( x 1, …, x N ) = ( x i, x − i ) {\\displaystyle x=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{N})=(x_{i},x_{-i})}, such that, for each agent i {\\displaystyle i}, x i ∈ A i ( x ) {\\displaystyle x_{i}\\in A_{i}(x)} and P i ( x ) ∩ A i ( x ) = ∅ {\\displaystyle P_{i}(x)\\cap A_{i}(x)=\\emptyset }. The equilibrium concept",
    "Exchange economy as a special case Definition Mas-Colell generalized the definition of exchange economy in the following way. For every consumer i, there is: A consumption-set Y i {\\displaystyle Y_{i}} - as above; An initial endowment vector w i ∈ R + l {\\displaystyle w_{i}\\in \\mathbb {R} _{+}^{l}} - as above; A preference relation ≺ i {\\displaystyle \\prec _{i}} that can be equivalently represented by a preference-correspondence P i : Y i ↠ Y i {\\displaystyle P_{i}:Y_{i}\\twoheadrightarrow Y_{i}}, that depends only on the consumed bundle: P i ( y i ) := { z i ∈ Y i | z i ≻ i y i } {\\displaystyle P_{i}(y_{i}):=\\{z_{i}\\in Y_{i}|z_{i}\\succ _{i}y_{i}\\}}. Note the preference relation is not required to be complete or transitive. Equilibrium A competitive equilibrium in such exchange economy is defined by a price-vector p and an allocation y such that: The sum of all prices is 1; The sum of all allocations y i {\\displaystyle y_{i}} is at most the sum of endowments w i {\\displaystyle w_{i}} ; For every i:",
    "Reduction to abstract economy The \"market maker\" reduction shown above, from the exchange economy of Arrow-Debreu to the abstract economy of Debreu, can be done from the generalized exchange economy of Mas-Collel to the generalized abstract economy of Shafer-Sonnenschein. This reduction implies that the following conditions are sufficient for existence of competitive equilibrium in the generalized exchange economy: Each ≺ i {\\displaystyle \\prec _{i}} is relatively-open (equivalently, each P i {\\displaystyle P_{i}} has an open graph); For every bundle x, the set P i ( x ) {\\displaystyle P_{i}(x)} is convex and does not contain x (= irreflexivity). Mas-Collel added the condition that the set P i ( x ) {\\displaystyle P_{i}(x)} is non-empty (= non-saturation). For every i: w i ≫ x i {\\displaystyle w_{i}\\gg x_{i}} for some bundle x (this means that the initial endowment is in the interior of the choice-sets). A negative example The following example shows that, when the open graph property does not hold, equilibrium may fail to exist. There is an economy with two goods, say apples and bananas. There are two agents with identical endowments (1,1).",
    "Note that P i ( a i, b i ) {\\displaystyle P_{i}(a_{i},b_{i})} represents a complete and transitive relation, but it does not have an open graph. This economy does not have an equilibrium. Suppose by contradiction that an equilibrium exists. Then the allocation of each agent must be lexicographically at least (1,1). But this means that the allocations of both agents must be exactly (1,1). Now there are two cases: if the price of bananas is 0, then both agents can afford the bundle (1,2) which is strictly better than their allocation. If the price of bananas is some p > 0 (where the price of apples is normalized to 1), then both agents can afford the bundle (1+p, 0), which is strictly better than their allocation. In both cases it cannot be an equilibrium price. Welfare theorems in abstract economies Fon and Otani study extensions of welfare theorems to the generalized exchange economy of Mas-Collel. They make the following assumptions: Each consumption-set Y i {\\displaystyle Y_{i}} is non-empty, convex, closed, and bounded below. The preference correspondence is non-empty: P i ( y i ) ≠ ∅ {\\displaystyle P_{i}(y_{i})\\neq \\emptyset } (this is a non-saturation condition).",
    "In other words, for every bundle z ∈ Y i {\\displaystyle z\\in Y_{i}} : if z ≻ i y i {\\displaystyle z\\succ _{i}y_{i}} then p ⋅ z > p ⋅ y i {\\displaystyle p\\cdot z>p\\cdot y_{i}} (if the agent strictly prefers z to his share, then the agent cannot afford z). A compensated equilibrium has the same feasibility and budget conditions, but instead of the preference condition, it satisfies: Compensated Preference: For every i and for every bundle z ∈ Y i {\\displaystyle z\\in Y_{i}} : if z ≻ i y i {\\displaystyle z\\succ _{i}y_{i}} then p ⋅ z ≥ p ⋅ y i {\\displaystyle p\\cdot z\\geq p\\cdot y_{i}}. A Pareto-optimal allocation is, as usual, an allocation without a Pareto-improvement. A Pareto-improvement of an allocation y {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {y} } is defined as another allocation y ′ {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {y'} } that is strictly better for a subset J {\\displaystyle J} of the agents, and remains the same allocation for all other agents. That is: ∑ i ∈ J y",
    "Attention economics is an approach to the management of information that treats human attention as a scarce commodity and applies economic theory to solve various information management problems. Description According to Matthew Crawford, \"Attention is a resource—a person has only so much of it.\" Thomas H. Davenport and John C. Beck add to that definition:Attention is focused mental engagement on a particular item of information. Items come into our awareness, we attend to a particular item, and then we decide whether to act. A strong trigger of this effect is that it limits the mental capability of humans and the receptiveness of information is also limited. Attention allows information to be filtered such that the most important information can be extracted from the environment while irrelevant details can be left out. Attention economics is an approach to the management of information that treats human attention as a scarce commodity and applies economic theory to solve various information management problems. Software applications either explicitly or implicitly take attention economy into consideration in their user interface design based on the realization that if it takes the user too long to locate something, they will find it through another application. This is done, for instance, by creating filters to make sure viewers are presented with information that is most relevant, of interest, and personalized based on past web search history.",
    "Erik Brynjolfsson, Seon Tae Kim and Joo Hee Oh show that this makes it possible to formally analyze the attention economy and putting values on free goods. Theory Research from a wide range of disciplines including psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and economics, suggest that humans have limited cognitive resources that can be used at any given time, when resources are allocated to one task, the resources available for other tasks will be limited. Given that attention is a cognitive process that involves the selective concentration of resources on a given item of information, to the exclusion of other perceivable information, attention can be considered in terms of limited processing resources. History The concept of attention economics was first theorized by psychologist and economist Herbert A. Simon when he wrote about the scarcity of attention in an information-rich world in 1971: [I]n an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.",
    "Simon's characterization of the problem of information overload as an economic one has become increasingly popular in analyzing information consumption since the mid-1990s, when writers such as Thomas H. Davenport and Michael Goldhaber adopted terms like \"attention economy\" and \"economics of attention\". Some writers have speculated that \"attention transactions\" will replace financial transactions as the focus of our economic system. Information systems researchers have also adopted the idea, and are beginning to investigate mechanism designs which build on the idea of creating property rights in attention (see Applications). Intangibles According to digital culture expert Kevin Kelly, by 2008, the modern attention economy is increasingly one where the consumer product costs virtually nothing to reproduce and the problem facing the supplier of the product lies in adding valuable intangibles that cannot be reproduced at any cost.",
    "Specifically, long-term attention can be considered according to the attention that people dedicate to managing their interactions with others. Dedicating too much attention to these interactions can lead to \"social interaction overload\", i.e. when people are overwhelmed in managing their relationships with others, for instance in the context of social network services in which people are the subject of a high level of social solicitations. Digital media and the internet facilitate participation in this economy by creating new channels for distributing attention. Ordinary people are now empowered to reach a wide audience by publishing their own content and commenting on the content of others. Social attention can also be associated to collective attention, i.e. how \"attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations\". Applications In advertising \"Attention economics\" treats a potential consumer's attention as a resource. Traditional media advertisers followed a model that suggested consumers went through a linear process they called AIDA (attention, interest, desire and action)."

    "The term \"economy\" is derived from the Latin word, which has its origins in the Ancient Greek words \"oikonomia\" and \"oikonomos.\" The first part, \"oikos,\" translates to \"house,\" while the second part, \"nemein,\" means \"to manage.\" The contemporary understanding of the term, referring to \"the economic system of a country or an area,\" began to emerge in the 1650s.\n\n\nThe concept of an economy has existed as long as humans have engaged in the production, supply, and distribution of goods and services. As societies evolved and became more complex, their economies expanded accordingly. \n\nOne of the earliest examples of a large-scale economy can be traced to Sumer, which developed a system based on commodity money. Subsequently, the Babylonians and their neighboring city-states established foundational economic practices that resemble modern economic principles. They introduced rules and laws concerning debt, legal contracts, and business practices, as well as concepts related to private property.\n\nThe Babylonians were pioneers in creating codified legal and administrative systems, which included courts, prisons, and government records. The ancient economy primarily relied on subsistence farming. \n\nThe term \"shekel\" is significant as it refers to both a unit of weight and currency used by Semitic peoples. Its earliest recorded usage dates back to approximately 3000 BC in Mesopotamia.",
    "An economy refers to the system encompassing the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services within a specific area. It is broadly defined as a social domain that highlights the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the management and utilization of resources.\n\nAn economy comprises a set of processes influenced by various factors, including culture, values, education, technological advancement, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources. These elements provide the context and conditions under which economic activities occur. Thus, the economic domain is characterized by interrelated human practices and transactions, rather than existing in isolation.\n\nEconomic agents can include individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments. Economic transactions take place when two parties agree on the value or price of a good or service, typically expressed in a specific currency. However, monetary transactions represent only a fraction of the broader economic landscape.\n\nEconomic activity is primarily driven by production, which utilizes natural resources, labor, and capital. Over time, economies have evolved due to technological advancements and innovations, leading to the development of new products, services, and processes. This evolution has also resulted in the expansion and diversification of markets, as well as changes in industrial relations, such as the transition from child labor to universal access to education in certain regions.",
    "The onset of the Industrial Revolution represents a significant turning point in human history, profoundly influencing nearly every aspect of daily life. In Europe, the emergence of capitalism began to supplant the mercantilist system, which is often associated with protectionist policies, leading to notable economic growth. This period is termed the Industrial Revolution due to the advancements in production methods and the division of labor, which facilitated the mass production of goods.\n\nThe contemporary understanding of \"the economy\" gained prominence during the American Great Depression of the 1930s. In the aftermath of two World Wars and the severe economic downturn of the Great Depression, policymakers sought innovative approaches to manage economic stability. This discourse included the ideas of economists such as Friedrich August von Hayek (1899–1992) and Milton Friedman (1912–2006), who advocated for global free trade and are often regarded as foundational figures of neoliberalism.\n\nConversely, the prevailing economic perspective during this period was championed by John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946). Keynes argued for increased state intervention in the markets, positing that government action could mitigate economic challenges and stimulate growth through the manipulation of aggregate demand. This approach, known as Keynesianism, has had a lasting impact on economic policy and theory.",
    "In modern consumer societies, there is an increasing emphasis on services, finance, and technology, collectively referred to as the knowledge economy. This shift is often represented through the three-sector model, which categorizes economic activities into three distinct sectors:\n\n1. \n2. \n3. \nIn addition to these primary sectors, modern economies also encompass various other sectors:\n\n- \n- \n- \nTogether, these sectors illustrate the complexity and diversity of modern economies, highlighting the significant role that services and knowledge play in contemporary society.",
    "During the early modern period, France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands sought to regulate trade through customs duties and mercantilist policies. Mercantilism, derived from the Latin term \nProminent bankers, such as Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773–1855), began financing national projects, including wars and infrastructure development. Consequently, the concept of economy evolved to encompass national interests, framing economic activities within the context of state governance.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution marked a significant turning point in economic thought. The Scotsman Adam Smith (1723–1790) is often regarded as the first modern economist. Influenced by the principles of physiocracy—a response to mercantilism—Smith articulated the foundational elements of a national economy. He posited that products are offered at a natural price determined by competition, supply and demand, and the division of labor. Smith argued that the primary motivation for free trade is human self-interest, which became a fundamental principle in economic theory.\n\nThomas Malthus (1766–1834) later expanded upon the concepts of supply and demand, applying them to the issue of overpopulation. His work contributed to the understanding of economic dynamics in relation to population growth and resource availability.",
    "The term \"barley/shekel\" historically referred to both a unit of currency and a unit of weight, similar to how the British Pound originally denoted a mass of one pound of silver. In ancient societies, the exchange of goods predominantly occurred through social relationships, with bartering being a common practice in marketplaces.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, from which the modern term \"economy\" is derived, many individuals were bond slaves to freeholders. Economic discussions during this period were often influenced by the concept of scarcity. Chinese economic law introduced the idea that a non-market economy could foster institutional innovation, allowing firms to maintain a legally protected tenure, shielded from bureaucratic exploitation.\n\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the economy was largely characterized by subsistence-level exchanges, primarily occurring within social groups. Notably, great conquerors sought what is now referred to as venture capital—derived from the Italian word \"ventura,\" meaning risk—to fund their military campaigns. The expectation was that the capital invested would be repaid through the goods acquired from newly discovered territories.\n\nThe explorations of figures such as Marco Polo (1254–1324), Christopher Columbus (1451–1506), and Vasco da Gama (1469–1524) contributed to the emergence of a global economy. The earliest enterprises were trading establishments, and in 1513, the first stock exchange was established in Antwerp. During this period, the concept of economy was primarily associated with trade,",

This model combines free market capitalism with social policies that aim to ensure fair competition and a level playing field for all participants.\n\n\nThe fall of the Iron Curtain and the subsequent transition of Eastern Bloc countries towards democratic governance and market economies brought renewed attention to the concept of a post-industrial society. This term emphasizes the growing significance of the service sector, which has increasingly overshadowed traditional industrialization.\n\nSome scholars attribute the first use of the term \"post-industrial society\" to Daniel Bell's 1973 book, \nThe advent of the Internet as a mass media and communication platform, particularly after 2000-2001, has further transformed economic landscapes. The rise of e-commerce and electronic businesses has led to the emergence of a global information society, characterized by interconnectedness and the increasing importance of digital communication and information exchange.",
    "Economic systems can be categorized into various types based on their structure and functioning. \n\nA market economy is characterized by the production and exchange of goods and services driven by supply and demand. Participants, known as economic agents, engage in transactions either through barter or by using a medium of exchange, such as currency. Prices in a market economy are determined by the interactions of buyers and sellers.\n\nIn a planned economy, the government or political agents exert control over the production, distribution, and pricing of goods and services. This system aims to allocate resources according to a predetermined plan rather than through market forces.\n\nA green economy emphasizes low carbon emissions and resource efficiency. In this model, economic growth and job creation are fostered through public and private investments that aim to reduce pollution, enhance energy efficiency, and preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\nThe gig economy is defined by short-term, flexible jobs that are often facilitated through digital platforms. Workers in this economy typically engage in on-demand tasks rather than traditional, long-term employment.\n\nThe global economy encompasses the interconnected economic systems of countries around the world. It reflects the collective economic activities and interactions among nations.\n\nThe informal economy consists of economic activities that are not regulated or taxed by the government. This sector includes a wide range of activities, from street vending to unregistered businesses.\n\n\nThe evolution of economies can be understood through several historical phases:\n\n1.    The ancient economy",
    "Economic analysis of a country typically relies on various economic indicators, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita being among the most conventional. While these measures can provide valuable insights, it is important to note that GDP only accounts for economic activities where monetary transactions occur. \n\nIn contemporary discourse, the term \"real economy\" is often employed by analysts and policymakers to refer to the segment of the economy focused on the actual production of goods and services. This contrasts with the \"paper economy,\" which pertains to the financial sector and activities related to buying and selling in financial markets.\n\nEconomic measurements can be categorized into two primary types: real values, which are adjusted for inflation (e.g., real GDP), and nominal values, which are not adjusted for inflation. This distinction is crucial for accurately assessing economic performance over time.\n\nThe study of economics is generally divided into two main branches: macroeconomics and microeconomics. While the primary focus remains on the social science of economics, related fields such as sociology, history, anthropology, and geography also contribute to the understanding of economic phenomena. \n\nPractical applications of economic principles can be found in various domains, including business, engineering, government, and healthcare, all of which engage in the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services.\n\nMacroeconomics is typically analyzed at regional and national levels, addressing a range of topics such as income and production, money supply,",
    "The term \"New Economy\" refers to the ongoing evolution of the American economic system, characterized by a shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-oriented one, driven by advancements in technology and innovation. This concept gained prominence during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, a period marked by rapid growth, low inflation, and high employment, which led to optimistic forecasts and, at times, unrealistic business plans.\n\n\nThe phrase \"New Economy\" was popularized by a 1983 cover article in \nFollowing a prolonged period of economic stagnation beginning in 1972, the United States experienced a notable acceleration in economic growth around 1995. This resurgence was largely attributed to enhanced productivity growth. From 1972 to 1995, the average growth rate of output per hour, an indicator of labor productivity, was approximately one percent per year. In contrast, between 1995 and 1999, this growth rate increased significantly to 2.65 percent. During this period, the United States also witnessed rising employment levels and a decline in inflation.\n\nEconomist Robert J. Gordon has contributed to the discourse surrounding the New Economy, analyzing its implications and the factors that have influenced its development. The New Economy continues to be a topic of interest and debate among economists and policymakers as it shapes the future of economic activity in the United States and beyond.",
    "In 2000, economist Robert J. Gordon argued that the benefits of computers for the majority of firms were marginal or even negative. He posited that the advantages of computer technology were primarily concentrated in the computer hardware and durable goods manufacturing sectors, which constitute a relatively small segment of the overall economy. Gordon's analysis involved examining significant gains in the business cycle to explain trends in aggregate productivity growth.\n\nGordon's views are informed by the Kondratiev wave theory, which suggests that economic growth occurs in long cycles, typically lasting around 50 years. According to this theory, the current economic phase, often referred to as the \"new economy,\" is part of a Kondratiev wave that is expected to conclude in the 2040s. This phase is characterized by innovations in various fields, including the Internet, nanotechnology, telematics, and bionics.\n\nThe term \"Dot-com\" is frequently associated with the Dot-com bubble, a period marked by the rapid rise of internet-based companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

    "Man, Economy, and State\" is a foundational work in the field of Austrian economics, authored by economist and political theorist Murray Rothbard. The book presents a comprehensive analysis of economic principles, emphasizing individual action and the role of human choice in economic processes.\n\nThe text is structured into several key sections, each addressing different aspects of economic theory. Rothbard begins by outlining the nature of human action, which he defines as purposeful behavior aimed at achieving specific ends. He argues that economics is fundamentally rooted in this concept of individual choice.\n\nRothbard explores various economic phenomena, including the market process, the role of prices, and the function of capital. He discusses the importance of private property and voluntary exchange in facilitating economic cooperation and growth. Additionally, Rothbard critiques government intervention in the economy, asserting that such actions often lead to inefficiencies and unintended consequences.\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. \n\"Man, Economy, and State\" has been influential in the development of libertarian economic thought and has garnered attention from both supporters and critics.

    "In recent years, some economists have posited that traditional economic laws may no longer apply, suggesting that new principles have emerged in the context of a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Proponents of this view argue that advancements in computer hardware and software are poised to significantly reshape the future economy, with information emerging as a critical asset in this new paradigm.\n\nNotable economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Blake Belding, have expressed skepticism regarding the efficacy of substantial investments in information technology, particularly in areas such as software development and underutilized fiber optic networks. They contend that a considerable portion of these investments may not yield the anticipated returns. However, this assessment may overlook the broader context, as data indicates that U.S. investment in information technology has remained robust since 2002. While some instances of overinvestment may exist, research on productivity suggests that many investments have effectively contributed to enhanced output.\n\nThe recession of 2001 challenged several of the more extreme predictions made during the preceding economic boom, lending support to economist Robert Gordon's argument that the contributions of computers to productivity may have been overstated. Nevertheless, subsequent studies have provided compelling evidence that significant investments in information and communication technology have indeed stimulated productivity growth.\n\nIn summary, while debates continue regarding the implications of information technology on economic theory, it is clear that the relationship between technological investment and productivity is complex and multifaceted. Further research is essential to fully understand the long-term effects of these investments on the economy.",

    "In theoretical economics, an abstract economy, also referred to as a generalized N-person game, is a model that integrates concepts from both microeconomics and game theory. This framework generalizes the standard model of an exchange economy and the conventional model of a game. An equilibrium in an abstract economy encompasses both the Walrasian equilibrium from microeconomics and the Nash equilibrium from game theory.\n\nThe concept was introduced by Gérard Debreu in 1952, who initially termed it the generalized N-person game and demonstrated the existence of equilibrium within this framework. Subsequently, Debreu, along with Kenneth Arrow, redefined the concept as an abstract economy and utilized the established existence result to prove the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium, also known as a competitive equilibrium, in the Arrow–Debreu model. Later, researchers Shafer and Sonnenschein expanded these theorems to include irrational agents—those with non-transitive and non-complete preferences.\n\n\n\nIn Debreu's model, an abstract economy consists of a finite number \\( N \\) of agents. For each agent \\( i \\), the following components are defined:\n\n- A choice set \\( X_i \\) (a subset of some Euclidean space \\( \\mathbb{R}^l \\)), representing the complete set of choices available to the agent.\n- The Cartesian product of all choice sets is defined as \\( X := \\pro",
    "The New Manufacturing Economy (NME) refers to the significant role of advanced manufacturing in the emergence of the New Economy. This term encompasses manufacturing processes that are enhanced by digital technologies, sophisticated systems, and a highly skilled workforce. The NME integrates networks, 3D printing, and various advanced capabilities into business strategies, thereby improving manufacturing practices.\n\nNotably, Thomas Friedman cites Lawrence F. Katz, highlighting the importance of economic development strategies that involve collaboration among universities, high-tech manufacturers, software and service providers, and agile start-ups. While the term \"New Manufacturing Economy\" may not be explicitly used in this context, the underlying concepts align closely with its principles.\n\n\nKey elements of the New Manufacturing Economy include a strong emphasis on technology, geographic expansion, information technology, and e-commerce. According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers Q4 2010 Manufacturing Barometer, these factors are increasingly important for industrial manufacturing companies. As a result, organizations are compelled to integrate new technologies into their business plans and to focus on open-source product development as a means of gaining competitive advantage.\n\nThe influence of new technologies extends across various industries, prompting a greater emphasis on innovation as a critical business tool.",
    "In economic theory, a market player is characterized by a choice set denoted as \\( X_N := \\Delta \\), which represents the set of possible price vectors. The utility function for the market player is defined as \\( U_N(y, p) := p \\cdot \\left( \\sum y_i - \\sum w_i \\right) \\), where \\( y \\) represents the quantities of goods consumed, \\( p \\) denotes the price vector, and \\( w \\) signifies the endowment of goods.\n\nThe market player's objective is to select a price that equilibrates supply and demand. When the supply of a commodity exceeds its demand, the right-hand term in the utility function \\( U_N(y, p) \\) becomes negative, prompting the market player to set a lower price. Conversely, if demand surpasses supply, the term is positive, leading the market player to establish a higher price.\n\nFor an exchange economy to achieve equilibrium, certain conditions must be met. Specifically, each consumption set \\( Y_i \\) must be compact and convex, with the endowment \\( w_i \\) located within its interior. Additionally, each utility function \\( V_i \\) should be continuous and quasi-concave. These conditions ensure that the abstract economy adheres to the principles of equilibrium.",
    "In economic theory, a weakening of the graph-continuity assumption is observed in the properties of utility functions. Specifically, each utility function \\( U_i \\) is characterized by quasi-concavity in \\( x_i \\), upper semi-continuity in \\( x \\), and the function \\( W_i(x_{-i}) := \\max_{x_i} U_i(x_i, x_{-i}) \\) is lower semi-continuous.

    "In the context of exchange economies, it is often assumed that all agents are not satiated. This assumption leads to the definition of the choice set for agent \\(i\\), denoted as \\(A_i(y, p) = \\{y_i \\in Y_i | p y_i \\leq p w_i\\}\\). This definition ensures that the total expenditure of each agent does not exceed their budget.\n\nAdditionally, the utility function \\(U_i = V_i\\) indicates that the consumption of each agent is optimized to maximize their utility within the constraints of their budget. Furthermore, the definition \\(U_N(y, p) := p \\cdot (\\sum y_i - \\sum w_i)\\) ensures that total consumption equals total endowment. \n\nConsequently, if an exchange economy meets these three conditions, a competitive equilibrium is established.

    "Attention economics is a framework for managing information that views human attention as a limited resource. This approach applies economic principles to address various challenges in information management.\n\nAccording to Matthew Crawford, \"Attention is a resource—a person has only so much of it.\" This concept is further elaborated by Thomas H. Davenport and John C. Beck, who define attention as \"focused mental engagement on a particular item of information.\" In this context, individuals encounter various items of information, selectively attend to specific ones, and subsequently decide whether to take action based on that information. \n\nA key aspect of attention economics is its recognition of the limitations of human cognitive capacity. The ability to process information is constrained, meaning that individuals can only engage with a finite amount of data at any given time. This selective attention enables individuals to filter information, allowing them to extract the most pertinent details from their environment while disregarding irrelevant content.\n\nIn practical applications, software developers often incorporate principles of attention economics into user interface design. This is based on the understanding that if users struggle to locate information quickly, they may turn to alternative applications. To enhance user experience, developers create filters that present information tailored to users' interests and preferences, often informed by their previous online behavior. This personalization aims to ensure that users receive the most relevant and engaging content, thereby optimizing their attention and engagement.",

If the price of bananas is denoted as \\( p > 0 \\) (with the price of apples normalized to 1), both agents can afford the bundle \\( (1 + p, 0) \\). This bundle is also strictly better than their allocation of \\( (1, 1) \\).\n\nIn both scenarios, the proposed price cannot constitute an equilibrium price.\n\n\nThe research conducted by Fon and Otani extends the welfare theorems to the generalized exchange economy as described by Mas-Colell. Their analysis is based on several key assumptions:\n\n",
    "As the cost of transmitting advertisements to consumers has significantly decreased, particularly through online platforms, the ability to deliver a greater volume of advertisements than consumers can effectively process has emerged. Consequently, consumer attention has become a scarce resource that requires careful allocation. This phenomenon, often referred to as \"information overload,\" can impede decision-making, as individuals may continue to search for and compare products, driven by the potential for greater benefits than the costs incurred.\n\nCritics have raised concerns regarding advertisers who create attention-grabbing content that is presented to consumers without their consent or compensation. This practice has been described as \"attention theft,\" highlighting the ethical implications of unsolicited advertising.\n\n\nOne approach to addressing the challenges posed by excessive information is to conceptualize various forms of information—such as spam and advertising—as a form of pollution or \"detrimental externality.\" In economics, an externality refers to a consequence of an economic activity that affects other parties who did not choose to be involved in that activity. For instance, air and water pollution are considered negative externalities that impose costs on society and the environment.\n\nA market-based approach to managing externalities was proposed by economist Ronald Coase in his seminal work, \"The Problem of Social Cost\" (1960). This concept evolved from Coase's earlier article on the Federal Communications Commission (1959), in which he argued that radio frequency interference represents a negative externality that could be mitigated through the establishment of"
