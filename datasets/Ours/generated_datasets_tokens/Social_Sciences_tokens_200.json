    "An economy is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services. In general, it is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources. A given economy is a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand alone. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain. Economic activity is spurred by production",
    "The Latin word has its origin at the Ancient Greek's oikonomia or oikonomos. The word's first part oikos means \"house\", and the second part nemein means \"to manage\". The most frequently used current sense, denoting \"the economic system of a country or an area\", seems not to have developed until the 1650s. History Earliest roots As long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complex. Sumer developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money, while the Babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on debt, legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property. The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts. They developed the first known",
    "A barley/shekel was originally both a unit of currency and a unit of weight, just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one-pound mass of silver. Most exchange of goods had occurred through social relationships. There were also traders who bartered in the marketplaces. In Ancient Greece, where the present English word 'economy' originated, many people were bond slaves of the freeholders. The economic discussion was driven by scarcity. In Chinese economic law, the huge cycle of institutional innovation contains an idea. Serving a non-market economy promotes a firm's tenure that is legally guaranteed and protected from bureaucratic opportunities. Middle Ages In the Middle Ages, what is now known as an economy was not far from the subsistence level. Most exchange occurred within social groups. On top of this, the great conquerors raised what we now call venture capital (from ventura, ital.; risk) to finance their captures. The capital should be refunded by the goods they would",
    "France, Great Britain and the Netherlands tried to control the trade through custom duties and mercantilism (from mercator, lat.: merchant) was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and public interest. The secularization in Europe allowed states to use the immense property of the church for the development of towns. The influence of the nobles decreased. The first Secretaries of State for economy started their work. Bankers like Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773–1855) started to finance national projects such as wars and infrastructure. Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the citizens of a state. Industrial Revolution The first economist in the true modern meaning of the word was the Scotsman Adam Smith (1723–1790) who was inspired partly by the ideas of physiocracy, a reaction to mercantilism and also later Economics student, Adam Mari. He defined the elements of a national economy: products are offered at a natural price generated",
    "The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some way. In Europe wild capitalism started to replace the system of mercantilism (today: protectionism) and led to economic growth. The period today is called industrial revolution because the system of Production, production and division of labor enabled the mass production of goods. 20th century The contemporary concept of \"the economy\" wasn't popularly known until the American Great Depression in the 1930s. After the chaos of two World Wars and the devastating Great Depression, policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy. This was explored and discussed by Friedrich August von Hayek (1899–1992) and Milton Friedman (1912–2006) who pleaded for a global free trade and are supposed to be the fathers of the so-called neoliberalism. However, the prevailing view was that held by John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946),",

In 1958, John Kenneth Galbraith (1908–2006) was the first to speak of an affluent society in his book The Affluent Society. In most of the countries the economic system is called a social market economy. 21st century With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Bloc towards democratic government and market economies, the idea of the post-industrial society is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the service sector receives instead of industrialization. Some attribute the first use of this term to Daniel Bell's 1973 book, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, while others attribute it to social philosopher Ivan Illich's book, Tools for Conviviality. The term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of postmodernism in the late 90s and especially in",
    "Elements Types A market economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants (economic agents) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency. A planned economy is one where political agents directly control what is produced and how it is sold and distributed. A green economy is low-carbon and resource efficient. In a green economy, growth in income and employment is driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance energy and resource efficiency, and prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. A gig economy is one in which short-term jobs are assigned or chosen on-demand. The global economy refers to humanity's economic system or systems overall. An informal economy is neither taxed nor monitored by any form of government. Sectors The economy may be considered as having developed through the following phases or degrees of precedence: The ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farming",
    "In the economies of modern consumer societies phase there is a growing part played by services, finance, and technology—the knowledge economy. In modern economies, these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by the three-sector model: Primary: Involves the extraction and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron. Secondary: Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. Tertiary: Involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses, such as baby-sitting, cinema and banking. Other sectors of the developed community include: the public sector or state sector (which usually includes: parliament, law-courts and government centers, various emergency services, public health, shelters for impoverished and threatened people, transport facilities, air/sea ports, post-natal care, hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, preserved historical buildings, parks/gardens, nature-reserves,",
    "The most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and GDP per capita. While often useful, GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged. Due to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times, the term real economy is used by analysts as well as politicians to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with the actual production of goods and services, as ostensibly contrasted with the paper economy, or the financial side of the economy, which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets. Alternate and long-standing terminology distinguishes measures of an economy expressed in real values (adjusted for inflation), such as real GDP, or in nominal values (unadjusted for inflation). Studies The study of economics are roughly divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics. Today, the range of fields of study examining the economy revolves around the social science of economics, but may also include sociology, history, anthropology, and geography. Practical fields directly related to the",

    "The New Economy refers to the ongoing development of the American economic system. It evolved from the notions of the classical economy via the transition from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy, and has been driven by new technology and innovations. This popular use of the term emerged during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where high growth, low inflation, and high employment of this period led to optimistic predictions and flawed business plans. Origins A 1983 cover article in Time, \"The New Economy\", described the transition from heavy industry to a new technology based economy. By 1997, Newsweek was referring to the \"new economy\" in many of its articles. After a nearly 25-year period of unprecedented growth, the United States experienced a much discussed economic slowdown beginning in 1972. However, around 1995, U.S. economic growth accelerated, driven by faster productivity growth. From 1972 to 1995, the growth rate of output per hour, a measure of labor productivity, had only averaged",
    "Gordon contended in 2000, that the benefits of computers were marginal or even negative for the majority of firms, with their benefits being consolidated in the computer hardware and durable goods manufacturing sectors, which only represent a relatively small segment of the economy. His method relied on applying considerably sized gains in the business cycle to explain aggregate productivity growth. According to the generally unaccepted Kondratiev wave theory of economy growth, the \"new economy\" is a current Kondratiev wave which will end after a 50-year period in the 2040s. Its innovative basis includes Internet, nanotechnologies, telematics and bionics. Dot-coms In the financial markets, the term has been associated with the Dot-com bubble. This included the emergence of the NASDAQ as a rival to the New York Stock Exchange, a high rate of IPOs, the rise of Dot-com stocks over established firms, and the prevalent use of tools such as stock options.

    "Some even claimed that the old laws of economics did not apply anymore and that new laws had taken their place. They also claimed that improvements in computer hardware and software would dramatically change the future, and that information is the most important value in the new economy. Some, such as Joseph Stiglitz and Blake Belding, have suggested that a lot of investment in information technology, especially in software and unused fibre optics, was useless. However, this may be too harsh a judgment, given that U.S. investment in information technology has remained relatively strong since 2002. While there may have been some overinvestment, productivity research shows that much of the investment has been useful in raising output. The recession of 2001 disproved many of the more extreme predictions made during the boom years, and gave credence to Gordon's minimization of computers' contributions. However, subsequent research strongly suggests that productivity growth has been stimulated by heavy investment in information and communication technology.",
    "The new manufacturing economy (NME) describes the role of advanced manufacturing in the rise of the New Economy. The term describes manufacturing enabled by digital technologies, advanced systems and processes and a highly trained and knowledgeable workforce. The new manufacturing economy integrates networks, 3D printers and other proficiencies into business strategies to further develop manufacturing practices. Thomas Friedman references Lawrence F. Katz that hubs of \"universities, high-tech manufacturers, software/service providers and highly nimble start-ups\" are a needed economic development strategy. This is very similar to NME thoughts even though that exact term is not used. The Pillars of the new manufacturing economy Technology Focus on geographic expansion, information technology and internet commerce are on the rise for industrial manufacturing companies according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers Q4 2010 Manufacturing Barometer.

    "In theoretical economics, an abstract economy (also called a generalized N-person game) is a model that generalizes both the standard model of an exchange economy in microeconomics, and the standard model of a game in game theory. An equilibrium in an abstract economy generalizes both a Walrasian equilibrium in microeconomics, and a Nash equilibrium in game-theory. The concept was introduced by Gérard Debreu in 1952. He named it generalized N-person game, and proved the existence of equilibrium in this game. Later, Debreu and Kenneth Arrow (who renamed the concept to abstract economy) used this existence result to prove the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium (aka competitive equilibrium) in the Arrow–Debreu model.

Items come into our awareness, we attend to a particular item, and then we decide whether to act. A strong trigger of this effect is that it limits the mental capability of humans and the receptiveness of information is also limited.

    "Erik Brynjolfsson, Seon Tae Kim and Joo Hee Oh show that this makes it possible to formally analyze the attention economy and putting values on free goods. Theory Research from a wide range of disciplines including psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and economics, suggest that humans have limited cognitive resources that can be used at any given time, when resources are allocated to one task, the resources available for other tasks will be limited. Given that attention is a cognitive process that involves the selective concentration of resources on a given item of information, to the exclusion of other perceivable information, attention can be considered in terms of limited processing resources. History The concept of attention economics was first theorized by psychologist and economist Herbert A. Simon when he wrote about the scarcity of attention in an information-rich world in 1971: [I]n an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes.",
    "Simon's characterization of the problem of information overload as an economic one has become increasingly popular in analyzing information consumption since the mid-1990s, when writers such as Thomas H. Davenport and Michael Goldhaber adopted terms like \"attention economy\" and \"economics of attention\". Some writers have speculated that \"attention transactions\" will replace financial transactions as the focus of our economic system. Information systems researchers have also adopted the idea, and are beginning to investigate mechanism designs which build on the idea of creating property rights in attention (see Applications). Intangibles According to digital culture expert Kevin Kelly, by 2008, the modern attention economy is increasingly one where the consumer product costs virtually nothing to reproduce and the problem facing the supplier of the product lies in adding valuable intangibles that cannot be reproduced at any cost.",
    "Specifically, long-term attention can be considered according to the attention that people dedicate to managing their interactions with others. Dedicating too much attention to these interactions can lead to \"social interaction overload\", i.e. when people are overwhelmed in managing their relationships with others, for instance in the context of social network services in which people are the subject of a high level of social solicitations. Digital media and the internet facilitate participation in this economy by creating new channels for distributing attention. Ordinary people are now empowered to reach a wide audience by publishing their own content and commenting on the content of others. Social attention can also be associated to collective attention, i.e. how \"attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among large populations\". Applications In advertising \"Attention economics\" treats a potential consumer's attention as a resource. Traditional media advertisers followed a model that suggested consumers went through a linear process they called AIDA (attention, interest, desire and action)."

In contrast, between 1995 and 1999, this growth rate increased significantly to 2.65 percent. During this period, the United States also witnessed rising employment levels and a",
    "In 2000, economist Robert J. Gordon argued that the benefits of computers for the majority of firms were marginal or even negative. He posited that the advantages of computer technology were primarily concentrated in the computer hardware and durable goods manufacturing sectors, which constitute a relatively small segment of the overall economy. Gordon's analysis involved examining significant gains in the business cycle to explain trends in aggregate productivity growth.\n\nGordon's views are informed by the Kondratiev wave theory, which suggests that economic growth occurs in long cycles, typically lasting around 50 years. According to this theory, the current economic phase, often referred to as the \"new economy,\" is part of a Kondratiev wave that is expected to conclude in the 2040s. This phase is characterized by innovations in various fields, including the Internet, nanotechnology, telematics, and bionics.\n\nThe term \"Dot-com\" is frequently associated with the Dot-com bubble, a period marked by the rapid",
    "Man, Economy, and State\" is a foundational work in the field of Austrian economics, authored by economist and political theorist Murray Rothbard. The book presents a comprehensive analysis of economic principles, emphasizing individual action and the role of human choice in economic processes.\n\nThe text is structured into several key sections, each addressing different aspects of economic theory. Rothbard begins by outlining the nature of human action, which he defines as purposeful behavior aimed at achieving specific ends. He argues that economics is fundamentally rooted in this concept of individual choice.\n\nRothbard explores various economic phenomena, including the market process, the role of prices, and the function of capital. He discusses the importance of private property and voluntary exchange in facilitating economic cooperation and growth. Additionally, Rothbard critiques government intervention in the economy, asserting that such actions often lead to inefficiencies and unintended consequences.\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. \n\"Man, Economy, and State\" has been influential",
    "In recent years, some economists have posited that traditional economic laws may no longer apply, suggesting that new principles have emerged in the context of a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Proponents of this view argue that advancements in computer hardware and software are poised to significantly reshape the future economy, with information emerging as a critical asset in this new paradigm.\n\nNotable economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Blake Belding, have expressed skepticism regarding the efficacy of substantial investments in information technology, particularly in areas such as software development and underutilized fiber optic networks. They contend that a considerable portion of these investments may not yield the anticipated returns. However, this assessment may overlook the broader context, as data indicates that U.S. investment in information technology has remained robust since 2002. While some instances of overinvestment may exist, research on productivity suggests that many investments have effectively contributed to enhanced output.\n\nThe recession of 2001 challenged several of the more extreme predictions made during the preceding economic",

    "In theoretical economics, an abstract economy, also referred to as a generalized N-person game, is a model that integrates concepts from both microeconomics and game theory. This framework generalizes the standard model of an exchange economy and the conventional model of a game. An equilibrium in an abstract economy encompasses both the Walrasian equilibrium from microeconomics and the Nash equilibrium from game theory.\n\nThe concept was introduced by Gérard Debreu in 1952, who initially termed it the generalized N-person game and demonstrated the existence of equilibrium within this framework. Subsequently, Debreu, along with Kenneth Arrow, redefined the concept as an abstract economy and utilized the established existence result to prove the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium, also known as a competitive equilibrium, in the Arrow–Debreu model. Later, researchers Shafer and Sonnenschein expanded these theorems to include irrational agents—those with non-transitive and non-complete preferences",
    "The New Manufacturing Economy (NME) refers to the significant role of advanced manufacturing in the emergence of the New Economy. This term encompasses manufacturing processes that are enhanced by digital technologies, sophisticated systems, and a highly skilled workforce. The NME integrates networks, 3D printing, and various advanced capabilities into business strategies, thereby improving manufacturing practices.\n\nNotably, Thomas Friedman cites Lawrence F. Katz, highlighting the importance of economic development strategies that involve collaboration among universities, high-tech manufacturers, software and service providers, and agile start-ups. While the term \"New Manufacturing Economy\" may not be explicitly used in this context, the underlying concepts align closely with its principles.\n\n\nKey elements of the New Manufacturing Economy include a strong emphasis on technology, geographic expansion, information technology, and e-commerce. According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers Q4 2010 Manufacturing Barometer, these factors are increasingly important for industrial manufacturing companies. As a result, organizations are compelled to integrate new technologies",
    "In economic theory, a market player is characterized by a choice set denoted as \\( X_N := \\Delta \\), which represents the set of possible price vectors. The utility function for the market player is defined as \\( U_N(y, p) := p \\cdot \\left( \\sum y_i - \\sum w_i \\right) \\), where \\( y \\) represents the quantities of goods consumed, \\( p \\) denotes the price vector, and \\( w \\) signifies the endowment of goods.\n\nThe market player's objective is to select a price that equilibrates supply and demand. When the supply of a commodity exceeds its demand, the right-hand term in the utility function \\( U_N(y, p) \\) becomes negative, prompting the market player to set a lower price. Conversely, if demand surpasses supply, the term is positive, leading the market player to establish a higher price.\n\n",
    "In economic theory, a weakening of the graph-continuity assumption is observed in the properties of utility functions. Specifically, each utility function \\( U_i \\) is characterized by quasi-concavity in \\( x_i \\), upper semi-continuity in \\( x \\), and the function \\( W_i(x_{-i}) := \\max_{x_i} U_i(x_i, x_{-i}) \\) is lower semi-continuous.

    "In the context of exchange economies, it is often assumed that all agents are not satiated. This assumption leads to the definition of the choice set for agent \\(i\\), denoted as \\(A_i(y, p) = \\{y_i \\in Y_i | p y_i \\leq p w_i\\}\\). This definition ensures that the total expenditure of each agent does not exceed their budget.\n\nAdditionally, the utility function \\(U_i = V_i\\) indicates that the consumption of each agent is optimized to maximize their utility within the constraints of their budget. Furthermore, the definition \\(U_N(y, p) := p \\cdot (\\sum y_i - \\sum w_i)\\) ensures that total consumption equals total endowment. \n\nConsequently, if an exchange economy meets these three conditions, a competitive equilibrium is established.

    "Attention economics is a framework for managing information that views human attention as a limited resource. This approach applies economic principles to address various challenges in information management.\n\nAccording to Matthew Crawford, \"Attention is a resource—a person has only so much of it.\" This concept is further elaborated by Thomas H. Davenport and John C. Beck, who define attention as \"focused mental engagement on a particular item of information.\" In this context, individuals encounter various items of information, selectively attend to specific ones, and subsequently decide whether to take action based on that information. \n\nA key aspect of attention economics is its recognition of the limitations of human cognitive capacity. The ability to process information is constrained, meaning that individuals can only engage with a finite amount of data at any given time. This selective attention enables individuals to filter information, allowing them to extract the most pertinent details from their environment while disregarding irrelevant content.\n\nIn practical applications, software developers often incorporate principles of",

    "Herbert Simon's characterization of information overload as an economic issue has gained prominence in the analysis of information consumption since the mid-1990s. Influential writers such as Thomas H. Davenport and Michael Goldhaber introduced concepts like \"attention economy\" and \"economics of attention\" to describe this phenomenon. Some theorists propose that \"attention transactions\" may supplant financial transactions as the central focus of the economic system.\n\nResearchers in information systems have also embraced this concept, exploring mechanisms that could establish property rights in attention. This exploration aims to address the challenges posed by the attention economy and its implications for both consumers and producers.\n\nDigital culture expert Kevin Kelly notes that by 2008, the modern attention economy increasingly features consumer products that are nearly costless to reproduce. Consequently, the challenge for suppliers lies in adding valuable intangibles that cannot be replicated, thereby enhancing the overall value of their offerings.",
    "The \"market maker\" reduction described herein transitions from the exchange economy of Arrow-Debreu to the abstract economy of Debreu. This process can similarly be applied to the generalized exchange economy of Mas-Colell and the generalized abstract economy of Shafer-Sonnenschein. \n\nThis reduction indicates that certain conditions are sufficient for the existence of competitive equilibrium within the generalized exchange economy:\n\n1. Each preference relation \\( \\prec_i \\) is relatively open, which is equivalent to stating that each preference ordering \\( P_i \\) has an open graph.\n2. For every bundle \\( x \\), the set \\( P_i(x) \\) is convex and does not include \\( x \\) itself, demonstrating irreflexivity.\n3. Mas-Colell introduced an additional condition that the set \\( P_i(x) \\) must be non-empty, ensuring non-saturation.\n4.",
    "Long-term attention refers to the sustained focus individuals allocate to managing their interactions with others. Excessive attention to these interactions can result in \"social interaction overload,\" a phenomenon where individuals feel overwhelmed by the demands of maintaining relationships, particularly within the context of social networking services that generate high levels of social solicitations.\n\nThe rise of digital media and the internet has transformed the landscape of attention management, providing new avenues for distributing attention. Individuals are now empowered to reach broad audiences by creating and sharing their own content, as well as engaging with the content produced by others. This shift has also led to the concept of collective attention, which examines how attention to novel items spreads and eventually diminishes within large populations.\n\n\nIn the realm of advertising, the concept of \"attention economics\" treats consumer attention as a valuable resource. Traditional media advertisers have historically employed a model known as AIDA, which stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action. This model outlines a linear process that consumers",
    "In economic theory, \\( P_i(a_i, b_i) \\) denotes a complete and transitive relation. However, it is important to note that this relation does not possess an open graph, indicating that the economy in question lacks an equilibrium.\n\nTo explore this concept further, let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that an equilibrium exists. Under this assumption, the allocation for each agent must be lexicographically at least \\( (1, 1) \\). This implies that both agents' allocations must be precisely \\( (1, 1) \\). \n\nTwo scenarios arise from this situation:\n\n1.    If the price of bananas is set to zero, both agents can afford the bundle \\( (1, 2) \\), which is strictly preferable to their current allocation of \\( (1, 1) \\).\n\n2.    If the price of bananas is denoted as \\( p > 0 \\)",
    "As the cost of transmitting advertisements to consumers has significantly decreased, particularly through online platforms, the ability to deliver a greater volume of advertisements than consumers can effectively process has emerged. Consequently, consumer attention has become a scarce resource that requires careful allocation. This phenomenon, often referred to as \"information overload,\" can impede decision-making, as individuals may continue to search for and compare products, driven by the potential for greater benefits than the costs incurred.\n\nCritics have raised concerns regarding advertisers who create attention-grabbing content that is presented to consumers without their consent or compensation. This practice has been described as \"attention theft,\" highlighting the ethical implications of unsolicited advertising.\n\n\nOne approach to addressing the challenges posed by excessive information is to conceptualize various forms of information—such as spam and advertising—as a form of pollution or \"detrimental externality.\" In economics, an externality refers to a consequence of an economic activity that affects other parties who did not choose to"
