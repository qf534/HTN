Capitalism, a term not current in the sphere of popular doctrines, did not exist in the time of Adam Smith, but it played a leading part in his ideal of society. It was his belief that the freedom of self-interest is essential to a society if it is to prosper.",

He considered it was just a case of his claiming that the concept was a neologism which had no history. He pointed out that in pre-capitalist England the customary order of things could be traced back to the reigns of Edward and Mary.",

He identified four key features that define advanced capitalism: (1) a decline in the role of violence as the most important instrument of class power, (2) a rising importance of the manipulation of public opinion in the name of capitalist interests through the institutions of civil society; (3) an expansion of rights for all; (4) a high degree of differentiation between employees and employers; (5) the main role of the party system in political life; (6) the limitation of economic choice; and (7) the trend of relations of class and wealth distribution, and, in particular, the management of the nation's wealth.

        "The methanol economy is a hypothetical future economy in which methanol and dimethyl ether are proposed as an alternative to fossil fuels for the storage of energy, ground transportation and the manufacture of synthetic hydrocarbons and their derivatives. The methanol economy is thus an alternative to the hydrogen economy and the ethanol economy, though these do not exclude each other. Methanol can be produced from various sources, and there is no reason to believe that this is incompatible with hydrogen economy.",

A consumption economy is one in which the principal element of the national income is domestic consumption, as opposed to the other great elements of the income, such as private domestic investment, government expenditure, and the difference between exports and imports. Domestic consumption is the prime mover of all the other elements. But there is much dispute about the seventy per cent figure, with some economists claiming that it is higher, and others claiming that it is lower.",

For many years, access to capital has been a problem for residents of these low-income neighborhoods. The fact that they did not have enough money to begin with has made it all the more difficult to start a business.",

All these obstacles are in fact obstacles to the new world.",
