        "Somehow the theory was accepted, a theory which says that if two mammals are closely related to each other, the smaller of the two has a shorter skull, and the larger a longer one. In placental and ruminant mammals this is true, as well as in marsupials; but, if this were true in mammals generally, the explanation would not have been found in them.",
        "Throughout the centuries, and especially since the 14th, the number of elderly people has been steadily increasing. In the Islamic world, a number of physicians made considerable contributions to the science of gerontology, among them Ishaq ibn Hunain (d. 910), who wrote a number of works on the treatment of dementia. The customary attitude to the care of elderly relatives was one of self-interest, but a recent study reveals that the old are, by their very nature, much more likely to take advantage of this.",
        "Evolutionary biologists study the processes which have given rise to the diversification of life on the globe, and trace it back to a common ancestor. Ecologists use their knowledge of various branches of science to gather, collect, analyze, and assemble data on the quality of air, food, soil, and water. Their work is essential for an understanding of the state of the environment and of its prospects for improvement and conservation. Evolutionary biology emphasizes natural selection, common descent, and gene duplication as the most important mechanisms of evolution.",

The second term, fp, is the fraction of stars having planets, while the third, fe, is the fraction of these planets which have conditions favorable to life. This formula is criticized because it cannot generate or support hypotheses because it includes so many unproven elements. The most important is fp, and that is quite uncertain.",
        "He is the father of experimental physiology, and his theories were followed for about thirteen hundred years. He is also the founder of modern anatomization. Galen, a famous physician and philosopher of the ancient times, distinguished three different parts in the human body: the brain and nerves, which are responsible for thinking and feeling; the heart and arteries, which are the life and circulation of the body; the liver and veins, which are responsible for the food and the nourishment of the body.",
        "The concept of traditional knowledge of a locality is to include the knowledge that indigenous and local communities have acquired, through generations, of their environment. This knowledge is often complex and nuanced, based on the particular environment in which these communities live.

        "It is a figure of speech, as it were, which takes the place of a logical explanation in drawing an analogy between a social group and a plant. For there is no distinction between parents and offspring; but as societies tend to branch out, forming separate entities, so do they behave like plants rather than animals. When the branches take hold and grow roots, they become a new part of the plant, and are treated as a new plant.",

This involves using a probe that binds to the active site.",
        "In general, the speed of enervation is inversely related to the weight of the animal, whereas the speed of muscle contraction is inversely related to the square root of the animal’s weight. The contractile properties of muscles are inherited in equal quantities, irrespective of the size of the animal. However, physiological scaling has a direct effect on the number of muscle fibres and their speed, and thus on the maximum power and efficiency of movement in different species. For example, the intrinsic frequency of a sparrow’s muscle fibres is 5,000 times higher than the frequency of muscle fibres in a horse, while in a fly the intrinsic frequency is 1,800 times higher than in a sparrow.",

A molecule can act on a corresponding cell, depending on the type of the cell; for example, the neur-otransmitters acting on ionotropic tans, which alter the excitability of the brain cells, by attaching themselves to the ionotropic receptors, may thus act on the modifying element of a cell, for instance, by modifying the irritability of the ionotropic ones. Activating the G-proteins leads to a cascade of second messengers, the phosphorylates of phosphodiesterases, which play a role in these alterations of the membrane potentials.",

From the time of the early modern period the art of anatomy only slowly progressed, especially as the Greek texts had been preserved in the Arab world, until the fifteenth century, when they were translated into Latin, bringing about a revival of anatomical study.",
        "The paper was then inserted into a plastic bag, containing a solution rich in fragments of DNA known as probes, extracted from the target. The dilution in the basic solution facilitated the movement of the DNA upwards towards a tissue. In the blotter, the corresponding DNA sequences on the paper were able to bind to the corresponding strands of the probes.",
        "Around a billion years ago, multicellular organisms appeared, in which the cells were differentiated according to their functions. The first evidence of eukaryotic life goes back to the year 850,000. It is possible that the eukaryotic cell may have appeared earlier, but the diversification of eukaryotic cells is considered to have greatly increased with the appearance of oxygen-utilizing anaerobic metabolism. The earliest known multicellular organisms on land were a kind of algae-like plant.",
        "Progress in the study of causation led the physicians to compare the symptoms of different diseases as they manifested themselves in the sick. This method of comparative analysis helped establish the fundamental idea that diseases could spread from one individual to another. Pathology is the study of the causes and effects of disease. Its object is the structural and physiological alterations in the tissue and organs of the sick.",
        "But the question remains whether we can conclude from this that the single-celled animals have perceptions, and whether the worms of the frogs have them. We cannot know how to find out, and for that reason we need to study their brains. Biological psychology is a science which aims to study natural kinds of cognition, as they occur in animals.",
        "On an exploration of the Galapagos rift in the Alvin submersible in 1976, the existence of a community of giant tube worms, a variety of molluscs, crustaceans, and many other creatures, at the foot of a submarine volcano known as a \"black smoker\", was proved, which contradicted the universal belief that life is able to exist only with the help of light. These organisms live in a dark, total darkness and form a community, which we have given the name of the \"community of the deep\".",
        "When a mosquito bites an animal, it introduces the infective larva into the animal; this larva migrates to the pulmonary artery, where it metamorphoses into a sandfly. Mosquitoes are a key means of transmission of certain parasites. The parasites can be classified according to the host on which they depend to accomplish their life cycle. The parasites that attack a single species usually have a direct life cycle.",
        "Anatomy is divided into two classes, the regional and the systemic. Anatomy can be studied by means of two classes of operations, the noxious and the innocuous. Microscopic anatomy is the study of the structure at the microscopic level, which includes histology, the study of tissues, and embryology, the study of the structure of embryos.",

The BTS in “water professions” includes various courses of study concerned with the management and control of water.",
        "The increase in the aging population has led to a greater need for social work and training for old people, and also for workers interested in the elderly. The numbers of men and women in this group of people are not equal. Especially the number of people in this age group, from 90 to 94 years old, has increased from 25.0% in 1990 to 26.4% in 2010.",

Within an ecosytem decomposers use the debris and the dead, together with the heat of metabolism, to digest organic material and to utilise almost the whole of the energy that does not reach the next trophic level.",
        "This study of allometry has been of great use in the mathematical treatment of the statistical relations between forms and figures, in the comparative study of the sizes of different animals, and in the study of the relative growth of the parts of animals of different sizes. It was first suggested by Otto Snell in 1892 and subsequently extended by D’Arcy Thompson in his best-known work, On Growth and Form.",
        "This field of research is transdisciplinary, involving the biological, mathematical, engineering, and other disciplines. Phenomics is the systematic study of the phenotypic traits. The word phenomics was coined by the ecologist Steven A. Garan, a researcher at the University of California, Berkley and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. The word phenomics derives from the Greek words phenomenon, meaning appearance, and oikon meaning flesh, and oikon meaning aspect.",
        "To the movement of the aquatic animals, which are remarkably slender, the resistance or the drag, which the pellucidity of the animal's sides produces, is the principal element. This drag is divided into two main types, the laminar flow and the turbulent flow. The higher the animal's size, the more energy is needed to push it and maintain its movement.",
        "Protistology is the science that studies the diverse group of protists; it is generally accompanied by phycology, mycology, microbiology, microscopy, parasitology, limnology, biology, natural history, zoology and botany. The word protistology was made common by Ernst Haeckel, and the study of protistology was not recognized until a recent period. Protistology is the study of the first animal organisms on the planet, with the exception of sponges.",
        "Although chemical biology is usually confused with biochemistry, a science that treats of the chemistry of the elements of life and the mechanism of the reactions of the molecules, chemical biology is not identical with it, for it is the use of chemical methods and of certain chemicals, often prepared by the process of synthetic chemistry, to investigate and to regulate the workings of the organism.",

        "Among the large mammals, whales are particularly blessed in the marine environment by their neutral buoyancy, which allows them to be fully supported by the density of the water. The result is an adaptation that allows long journeys with a minimum of expenditure. To travel far and to dive deep requires a combination of endurance, the economy of movement, the entrainment of a laminar current, to reduce resistance and turbulence. The terrestrial animal, on the contrary, is a voracious feeder, who runs after the wind and wastes its energy in the re-absorption of oxygen.",
        "The epithelial cells on the surface of the skin generally secrete an extracellular matrix which forms a protective cuticle. The keratin cells constitute about ninety-five per cent of the cells of the skin.

        "The dispersion of aero-biological particles is a process which is composed of three stages, the liberation from the source, the settling, and the deposition of the particles. The geometry of the particles and the environment of the air are both influential in these three stages. The conditions of the upper atmosphere resemble those of the surface of Mars, and the micro-organisms which are discovered in this zone are redefining the conditions of life.",
        "In low latitudes, marine invertebrates generally have numerous eggs which give rise to pelagic larvae, often planktotrophic, but at the poles fewer but larger eggs are laid, which are generally lecithotrophic, or yolk-feeding; and at high latitudes these eggs are fewer but larger, and often develop into viviparous or ovoviviparous young. The corals are embryos which, on leaving the egg, attach themselves to the surface and develop within the seaweed.",
        "Forensic ornithology plays a decisive role in many areas: in criminal investigations, in the administration of nature, in the conservation of species. Blood samples, which are collected in the course of an operation, serve to identify species by means of DNA. Forensic odontology, also called forensic dentistry, involves the study of teeth.",
        "In learning, comparators play a crucial role. A COMPARATOR, also called a ‘comparator,’ is a system of a neuronal group, as found in the fields of biophysics, biology and neurology. By means of comparison, it enables the organism to adapt to changes in the environment.",
        "The air-breathing costs, in proportion to oxygen-consumption, are proportional to the ratio M. For example, in mammals the lung volume averages about 63 ml./Kg., while the resting tidal volume is about a tenth of the total. Thus the size of the lungs in mammals is proportional to their size, and, as in the lungs of birds, is proportional to the air-breathing costs.",
        "A LIFE CYCLE, in biology, a series of stages, which an animal passes through from its inception as a zygote in an egg, to the age when it can reproduce. This cycle is completed by the birth of the young, which are themselves zygotes and thus repeating the whole thing.",

        "Various methods have been applied for the detection of metabolites, the most common of which are mass spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy. Metabolites must be identified and quantified to determine the quantity of the metabolites produced in the body. In this respect both methods are presently being used, with increasing success.",
        "In some forms of life, the expression of a gene is regulated by epigenetic modifications of the chromatin. Chromatin is a complex of DNA and other constituents of the cell which can modify the action of a gene without altering its sequence. Structural genes code for structural proteins which are not responsible for the regulation of the gene. These genes are called transcribed.",
        "Two separate types of gamete — such as male and female gametes — unite to form a zygote. An organism thus enters the haplontic cycle when it comes to the end of its diploid phase and produces haploid cells. Haplotic cells are capable of dividing by mitosis, which results in multicellular organisms or new haploid cells. This cycle continues as long as the zygote is the only diploid cell and as long as mitosis occurs only in the zygote.",
        "The dye that is on the 5' end of the probe, but is quenched by the 5' end of the probe, is degraded by the exonuclease action of the polymerase. Thereby the dye is removed from the probe and the fluorescence is generated. The fluorescence is mapped on a graph of the sample.",
        "The following are important observations. 1. The theory of death by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross has been subjected to various critiques. Interdisciplinary research by Robert J. Kastenbaum shows that “Individuality and universality mingle in the same experience.” The phase theory, based on the critiques of the Kubler-Ross model, has resulted in a shift in the orientation of research to the study of factors that influence the process of dying rather than in the classification of the process into stages.",
        "Biosemiotics has recently been greatly influenced by the Copenhagen-Tartu school. Biosemiotics is an interdisciplinary research field focusing on the role of signs and meaning in biological processes.

        "One of the fundamental principles of the transmission of alleles from parents to offspring is that they exist in a very small number of alleles. Mendelian transmission of the heredity is the system by which heredity is passed on from parents to offspring. The inherited properties of plants, for example, can be expressed by two alleles, such as purple and white flowers, which give them a mixed hereditary nature.",
        "In a paper written in the spring of 1977, Brian C. Goodwin discussed the concept of “cognitive biology” in the context of morphogenesis, as well as “action at a distance” in animals.

It is largely based on the seminal work of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana, who developed the concept of autopoiesis in the early seventies.",
        "The field of biosemiotics (which comes from the Greek bios meaning life and semios meaning sign, or the watcher of signs) is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements of biology and semiotics. It focuses on the processes of understanding and biological interpretation, the creation of signs and codes, and the biological mode of communication.",
        "The study of the phenology of plants began with Adolphe Quetelet, who occupied himself with the observation of plants at the Royal Observatory of Belgium, in Brussels, and who was a pioneer of the science. The word ‘phenology’ was first introduced by Charles François Antoine Morren, professor of botany at the University of Liège. In 1839 Quetelet began his observations, establishing a network of stations in Belgium and a laboratory at Liège.",

        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a concept derived from the field of psychology. It is a problem-solving method based on trial and error. The extracted features, functions, structures, and dynamics of the molecules in the data are analyzed. For example, gene expression is quantified, the splicing junction is predicted, and the phosphoproteome is examined. The problem is divided into two parts. The first part is the collection and transformation of these data.",
        "When the isometric growth of an organism doubles, the surface quadruples and the volume and weight quadruples, thereby posing important problems for the organism. This is the principle of isometric growth, which is governed by the square-cube law, which indicates how changes in the dimensions of an organism affect its surface and volume as it grows. For example, if the dimensions of an organism double, the surface quadruples and the volume increases eightfold.",
        "Early mention of microorganisms may be traced back to the Jain scriptures, the oldest of which, the Tirthapurisastra, was written in the sixth century before Christ. It mentions Nigoda or submicroscopic worms that were said to inhabit water, air, earth and fire. These were said to move in groups, and to have the nature of an electric spark.",
        "One of the great scientific advances of this period was the change in emphasis in the research of the life sciences, which focused on new models, such as viruses and bacteria.

        "In the past, it was common to view cognition as a function in which one could largely separate the physical bases of thought. This view led to the idea that a general principle applicable to the functioning of thought could be applicable to both living organisms and artificial systems. The method of cognitive biology aims to show the intrinsic relation between cognition and biology. It is also based on the assumption that the separation between the two is not a natural phenomenon."
