Artists sought to create new forms of expression that were in tune with the rapidly changing world around them. This period saw the rise of movements such as Cubism, Surrealism, and Dada, each bringing its own unique vision to the world of art. \n\nPostmodernism, which emerged in the late 20th century, further questioned the boundaries of art and challenged the notion of a singular, universal truth. Postmodern artists embraced diversity, incorporating elements of popular culture and rejecting the idea of a single, dominant artistic style. This period saw a proliferation of styles and approaches, as artists sought to break free from the constraints of tradition and explore new forms of expression. \n\nOverall, the arrival of Modernism and postmodernism marked a significant shift in the conception of art, leading to a more diverse and inclusive artistic landscape. Artists continue to push the boundaries of what is considered art, challenging conventions and exploring new ideas in their quest for self-expression and creativity.",
