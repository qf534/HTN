They break down dead organic material, such as debris and dry organic matter, into simpler substances that can be absorbed by other organisms. In the process, water loss occurs from metabolic processes, which accounts for approximately ninety percent of all energy not transferred to the other trophic stages.\n\nOverall, decomposers help maintain the balance of nutrients in the ecosystem by returning them to the soil or water for reuse by other organisms.

This is not only crucial for the long-term survival of species and ecosystems but also for the well-being and sustainability of human societies.\n\nResilience can be defined as the ability of a system to absorb and adapt to disturbances while maintaining its essential functions and structure. In the context of aging individuals, resilience becomes increasingly important as the body's ability to recover and respond to stressors declines. By promoting resilience through healthy lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management techniques, individuals can improve their overall well-being and quality of life as they age.\n\nFurthermore, recognizing the role of resilience in biological systems can inform conservation efforts and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of human activities on the environment. By promoting genetic diversity, restoring habitats, and reducing pollution and habitat destruction, we can help enhance the resilience of natural ecosystems and ensure their continued viability in the face of environmental challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, resilience is a vital trait that plays a critical role in both individual health and the sustainability of ecosystems. By understanding and promoting resilience in biological systems, we can adapt to changing environmental conditions and safeguard the future of our planet for generations to come.",
