Her work focused on how the Cherokee categorize plants based on their healing properties and traditional uses. Foster's research shed light on the intricate knowledge and classification systems of indigenous peoples regarding medicinal plants.\n\nIn the 1960s, the influential ethnobiologist Richard Schultes made significant contributions to the study of plant classification among indigenous tribes in the Amazon rainforest. Through his fieldwork and collaboration with local communities, Schultes documented how the tribes classified plants based on their ecological, medicinal, and cultural significance. His work paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between people and plants in traditional societies.\n\nOverall, these key developments in the mid-20th century marked a shift towards more deliberate and culturally sensitive approaches to studying ethnobiology.
