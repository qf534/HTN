        "Revise this with your best effort": "Dollo's law of irreversibility, established by Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo in 1893, states that organisms tend to adapt and evolve in response to their environment. Specifically, Dollo's law suggests that as an organism adapts to a colder environment, it is likely to become more specialized and less able to revert to its original form.
