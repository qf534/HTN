It seeks to understand how factors such as social relationships, living conditions, and access to healthcare can impact the well-being of older adults. By studying these relationships, researchers can develop interventions and policies that promote healthy aging and reduce disparities in later life.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of cumulative advantage and disadvantage suggests that the advantages and disadvantages experienced early in life can snowball over time, leading to widening gaps in wealth, health, and overall well-being. This theory highlights the importance of addressing inequalities at all stages of life to prevent long-term negative outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the complex interplay between individual circumstances and external factors is crucial for promoting equality and improving quality of life for older adults.

Conklin's research laid the foundation for future studies in ethnobiology that focused on how different societies categorize and interact with the natural world.\n\nAdditionally, during this time period, scholars like E. N. Anderson and Richard Schultes were also making important contributions to the field of ethnobiology. Anderson's work on the classification of folk biological knowledge in South America and Schultes' research on the cultural significance of plants in the Amazon rainforest further advanced our understanding of ethnobiological classification systems.\n\nOverall, the mid-20th century marked a turning point in the study of ethnobiology, as researchers began to shift towards more consciously framed approaches that focused on classificatory schemes. These developments laid the groundwork for future research in the field and helped to deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between humans and the natural world."
