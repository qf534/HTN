However, research has shown that this approach is not as effective as originally thought. \n\nRecent studies have indicated that conservation subdivisions, which dedicate smaller portions of land to conservation while allowing for more intensive development, are actually more efficient at protecting and renewing threatened resources. Additionally, traditional construction methods have also been shown to be more effective in maintaining these resources long-term. \n\nThese findings suggest that it may be more beneficial to prioritize conservation subdivisions and conventional construction methods over CLDPs in order to better protect our environment. Further research and analysis are needed to fully understand the implications of these results and make informed decisions regarding land development projects."
