They posit that true development should be defined as a comprehensive and sustainable improvement in the quality of life for all individuals within a community. According to their perspective, per capita income alone is an inadequate measure of overall standard of living.\n\nTo illustrate this point, they developed a novel method in 1997 that calculates per capita income by factoring in two key components: a \"development coefficient\" and a \"life expectancy index.\" This innovative approach challenges the conventional wisdom that economic growth alone is sufficient for achieving a higher standard of living, emphasizing the importance of addressing broader social and environmental factors in the quest for true development."
