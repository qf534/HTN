Rodney argued that countries should not be classified as \"developing\" or \"underdeveloped\" based solely on their economic status, as this overlooks the complex historical, social, and political factors that have contributed to their current state.\n\nInstead, Rodney proposed a more nuanced understanding of these terms that takes into account the unique circumstances of each country and recognizes the impact of colonization, imperialism, and exploitation on their development. He emphasized the need to move away from simplistic, binary categorizations and to adopt a more holistic approach that considers the interconnected nature of global systems and the ways in which they have shaped the trajectories of different nations.\n\nBy challenging the conventional definitions of \"developing\" and \"underdeveloped\" countries, Rodney highlighted the importance of critically examining the language we use to describe and categorize nations, as well as the underlying assumptions and power dynamics that inform these classifications.

In both cases, these entities are not merely facilitating transactions but are also providing a service that helps individuals meet their needs or desires.\n\nBy expanding our understanding of matchmakers to include all-digital entities, we can see how platforms operate in diverse environments and industries. Whether it's through a digital app or a physical location, matchmakers play a crucial role in bringing people together and facilitating connections. This broad view of matchmaking highlights the importance of intermediaries in today's interconnected world and underscores the value they provide in linking clients with solutions or customers."
