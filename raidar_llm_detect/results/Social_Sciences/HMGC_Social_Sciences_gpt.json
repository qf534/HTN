        "Improve this in GPT way": "ced. When the utility of a product increases, consumers are more willing to purchase it, leading to an upward-sloping demand curve. This demand curve is shaped by the marginal utility curves, showing how consumers allocate their resources based on the additional satisfaction gained from each unit of a good.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between supply and demand is influenced by consumer preferences and the marginal utility of goods. This dynamic interplay results in a balanced market where prices and quantities are determined by the preferences and behavior of consumers."
