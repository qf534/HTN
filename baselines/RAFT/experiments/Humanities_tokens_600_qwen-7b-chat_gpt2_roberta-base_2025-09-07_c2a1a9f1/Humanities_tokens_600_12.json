{"original": "Imitation is a fundamental instinct of human nature. According to Aristotle, this instinct is complemented by a natural inclination toward harmony and rhythm, with meters serving as distinct segments of rhythm. Individuals, starting from this inherent ability, gradually develop their unique talents, ultimately leading to the creation of poetry through their initial improvisations.\n\n\nArt offers a pathway to explore one's relationship with the universe. This exploration often occurs spontaneously, as individuals engage with various forms of art, including music and poetry. Albert Einstein posited that the most profound experience one can have is the encounter with the mysterious, which he regarded as the foundation of all genuine art and science.\n\n\nArt serves as a medium for expressing imagination in ways that transcend the constraints of formal language. Unlike words, which are sequenced and carry specific meanings, art encompasses a diverse array of forms, symbols, and ideas, allowing for interpretations that are fluid and adaptable. For instance, the representation of Jupiter's eagle transcends mere logical attributes; it embodies the concepts of sublimity and majesty, inspiring the imagination to explore a multitude of related representations that provoke deeper contemplation than can be encapsulated by words alone.", "sampled": "Imitation is a fundamental instinct of human nature.
