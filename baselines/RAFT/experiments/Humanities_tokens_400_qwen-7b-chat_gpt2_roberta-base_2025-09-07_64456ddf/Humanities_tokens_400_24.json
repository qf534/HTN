This evolution suggests that engagement with art is increasingly seen as an upper-class activity.

Many pre-modern controversies are poorly documented or have been lost to contemporary understanding. \n\n\nAdditionally, art has faced criticism for its portrayal of unpopular figures, political parties, or groups. Artistic conventions, often upheld by critics, can be conservative and rigorously enforced, although public reception may vary. The iconographic content of artworks can also provoke controversy, as seen in late medieval depictions of the Swoon of the Virgin during the Crucifixion of Jesus.", "sampled": "In contemporary discussions of art, the marker of status has shifted from ownership to understanding the work itself.
