{"original": "Throughout history, artists have sought to create works that resist commodification and cannot be acquired by the wealthy as mere status symbols. A significant motivation for many artists during the late 1960s and 1970s was to produce art that transcended traditional buying and selling. Prominent post-war German artist Joseph Beuys articulated this sentiment, stating, \"It is necessary to present something more than mere objects.\"\n\nThis era witnessed the emergence of various art forms, including performance art, video art, and conceptual art. The underlying principle was that if an artwork existed as a performance or an idea, it could not be commodified. The notion that art should not be treated as a commodity spurred aesthetic innovations that flourished in the mid-1960s and continued throughout the 1970s. Artists associated with Conceptual art often replaced traditional material forms with performance and publishing activities, aiming to challenge the perception of the art object as a mere commodity.\n\nIn subsequent decades, however, the initial intentions behind these movements have been somewhat overshadowed. The art market has adapted by finding ways to monetize these non-traditional forms, such as selling limited edition DVDs of video works, offering exclusive invitations to performance art events, and marketing the remnants of conceptual pieces. This evolution raises questions about the ongoing tension between artistic intent and market dynamics.", "sampled": "Throughout history, artists have sought to create works that resist commodification and cannot be acquired by the wealthy as mere status absorbed.
