{"original": "Attention economics is a framework for managing information that views human attention as a limited resource. This approach applies economic principles to address various challenges in information management.\n\nAccording to Matthew Crawford, \"Attention is a resource\u2014a person has only so much of it.\" This concept is further elaborated by Thomas H. Davenport and John C. Beck, who define attention as \"focused mental engagement on a particular item of information.\" In this context, individuals encounter various items of information, selectively attend to specific ones, and subsequently decide whether to take action based on that information. \n\nA key aspect of attention economics is its recognition of the limitations of human cognitive capacity. The ability to process information is constrained, meaning that individuals can only engage with a finite amount of data at any given time. This selective attention enables individuals to filter information, allowing them to extract the most pertinent details from their environment while disregarding irrelevant content.\n\nIn practical applications, software developers often incorporate principles of attention economics into user interface design. This is based on the understanding that if users struggle to locate information quickly, they may turn to alternative applications. To enhance user experience, developers create filters that present information tailored to users' interests and preferences, often informed by their previous online behavior. This personalization aims to ensure that users receive the most relevant and engaging content, thereby optimizing their attention and engagement.", "sampled": "Attention economics is a framework for managing information that views human attention as a limited resource.
