{"original": "Economic systems can be categorized into various types based on their structure and functioning. \n\nA market economy is characterized by the production and exchange of goods and services driven by supply and demand. Participants, known as economic agents, engage in transactions either through barter or by using a medium of exchange, such as currency. Prices in a market economy are determined by the interactions of buyers and sellers.\n\nIn a planned economy, the government or political agents exert control over the production, distribution, and pricing of goods and services. This system aims to allocate resources according to a predetermined plan rather than through market forces.\n\nA green economy emphasizes low carbon emissions and resource efficiency. In this model, economic growth and job creation are fostered through public and private investments that aim to reduce pollution, enhance energy efficiency, and preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\nThe gig economy is defined by short-term, flexible jobs that are often facilitated through digital platforms. Workers in this economy typically engage in on-demand tasks rather than traditional, long-term employment.\n\nThe global economy encompasses the interconnected economic systems of countries around the world. It reflects the collective economic activities and interactions among nations.\n\nThe informal economy consists of economic activities that are not regulated or taxed by the government. This sector includes a wide range of activities, from street vending to unregistered businesses.\n\n\nThe evolution of economies can be understood through several historical phases:\n\n1.    The ancient economy primarily relied on subsistence farming, where communities produced just enough to meet their basic needs.\n\n2.    The industrial revolution marked a significant shift from subsistence farming to more extensive and mono-cultural agricultural practices. This period also saw substantial growth in mining, construction, and manufacturing industries, which played a crucial role in economic development over the last three centuries. \n\nThese phases illustrate the dynamic nature of economic systems and their adaptation to changing societal needs and technological advancements.", "sampled": "Economic systems can be categorized into various types based that their structure and functioning. \n\nA market economy is characterized by the production and exchange of goods and institutions driven into supply and adapt.
