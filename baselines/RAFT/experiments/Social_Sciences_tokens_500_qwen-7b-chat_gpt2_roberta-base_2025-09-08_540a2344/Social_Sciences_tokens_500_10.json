{"original": "In 2000, economist Robert J. Gordon argued that the benefits of computers for the majority of firms were marginal or even negative. He posited that the advantages of computer technology were primarily concentrated in the computer hardware and durable goods manufacturing sectors, which constitute a relatively small segment of the overall economy. Gordon's analysis involved examining significant gains in the business cycle to explain trends in aggregate productivity growth.\n\nGordon's views are informed by the Kondratiev wave theory, which suggests that economic growth occurs in long cycles, typically lasting around 50 years. According to this theory, the current economic phase, often referred to as the \"new economy,\" is part of a Kondratiev wave that is expected to conclude in the 2040s. This phase is characterized by innovations in various fields, including the Internet, nanotechnology, telematics, and bionics.\n\nThe term \"Dot-com\" is frequently associated with the Dot-com bubble, a period marked by the rapid rise of internet-based companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This era saw the emergence of the NASDAQ as a significant competitor to the New York Stock Exchange, a surge in initial public offerings (IPOs), and the notable rise of Dot-com stocks compared to established firms. Additionally, this period was characterized by the widespread use of financial instruments such as stock options.\n\nIn the broader economic context, the Dot-com era was linked to practices such as outsourcing, business process outsourcing, and business process re-engineering.
