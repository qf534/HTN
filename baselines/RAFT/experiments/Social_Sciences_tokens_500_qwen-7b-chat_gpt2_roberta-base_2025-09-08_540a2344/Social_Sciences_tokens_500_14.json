{"original": "In theoretical economics, an abstract economy, also referred to as a generalized N-person game, is a model that integrates concepts from both microeconomics and game theory. This framework generalizes the standard model of an exchange economy and the conventional model of a game. An equilibrium in an abstract economy encompasses both the Walrasian equilibrium from microeconomics and the Nash equilibrium from game theory.\n\nThe concept was introduced by G\u00e9rard Debreu in 1952, who initially termed it the generalized N-person game and demonstrated the existence of equilibrium within this framework. Subsequently, Debreu, along with Kenneth Arrow, redefined the concept as an abstract economy and utilized the established existence result to prove the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium, also known as a competitive equilibrium, in the Arrow\u2013Debreu model. Later, researchers Shafer and Sonnenschein expanded these theorems to include irrational agents\u2014those with non-transitive and non-complete preferences.\n\n\n\nIn Debreu's model, an abstract economy consists of a finite number \\( N \\) of agents.
