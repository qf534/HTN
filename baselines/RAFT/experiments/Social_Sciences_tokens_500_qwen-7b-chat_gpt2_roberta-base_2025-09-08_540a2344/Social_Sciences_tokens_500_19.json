{"original": "In the context of exchange economies, it is often assumed that all agents are not satiated.

This definition ensures that the total expenditure of each agent does not exceed their budget.\n\nAdditionally, the utility function \\(U_i = V_i\\) indicates that the consumption of each agent is optimized to maximize their utility within the constraints of their budget. Furthermore, the definition \\(U_N(y, p) := p \\cdot (\\sum y_i - \\sum w_i)\\) ensures that total consumption equals total endowment. \n\nConsequently, if an exchange economy meets these three conditions, a competitive equilibrium is established.
