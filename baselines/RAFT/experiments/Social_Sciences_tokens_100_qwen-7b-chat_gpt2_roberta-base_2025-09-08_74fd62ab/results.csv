28,"In economic theory, \( P_i(a_i, b_i) \) denotes a complete and transitive relation. However, it is important to note that this relation does not possess an open graph, indicating that the economy in question lacks an equilibrium.

To explore this concept further, let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that an equilibrium exists. Under this assumption, the allocation for each agent must be lexicographically at least \( (1, 1)","In economic theory, \( P_i(a_i, b_i) \) denotes a complete and transitive relation.
