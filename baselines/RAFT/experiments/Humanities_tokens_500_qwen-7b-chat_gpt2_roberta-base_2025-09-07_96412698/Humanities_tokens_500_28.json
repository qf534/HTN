{"original": "The emergence of the New Criticism school sparked significant debate regarding the intentional fallacy. This concept revolves around the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of an artist should influence the criticism and evaluation of their work. Specifically, it examines whether a work of art should be assessed based on its own merits, independent of the artist's intentions.\n\nIn 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a seminal and contentious essay titled \"The Intentional Fallacy.\" In this work, they argued against the relevance of an author's intention, or \"intended meaning,\" in the analysis of literary texts. Wimsatt and Beardsley posited that the text itself should be the sole focus of literary analysis, asserting that any external meanings derived from the author's intentions could be distracting and irrelevant.\n\nIn conjunction with this essay, Wimsatt and Beardsley also authored \"The Affective Fallacy,\" which addressed the role of the reader's personal and emotional responses in literary analysis. They contended that such reactions should not be considered valid means of evaluating a text. This perspective was later challenged by theorists associated with the reader-response school of literary theory. Notably, Stanley Fish, a prominent figure in this movement, was initially trained in New Criticism and critiqued Wimsatt and Beardsley in his 1970 essay \"Literature in the Reader.\" \n\nThe discussions surrounding the intentional and affective fallacies continue to influence literary criticism and theory, highlighting the ongoing tension between authorial intent, textual analysis, and reader interpretation.", "sampled": "The emergence by the New Criticism school sparked significant debate regarding the intentional fallacy.
