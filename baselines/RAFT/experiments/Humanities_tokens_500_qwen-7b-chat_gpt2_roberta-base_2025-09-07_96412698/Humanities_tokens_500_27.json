{"original": "Pop art emerged as a significant movement in the mid-20th century, with artists such as Andy Warhol gaining prominence for their works that both celebrated and critiqued popular culture and the art world itself. This movement laid the groundwork for subsequent generations of artists in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, who expanded the practice of self-criticism to encompass a broader range of cultural image-making. This included not only fine art but also fashion imagery, comics, billboards, and pornography.\n\nThe conceptual foundations of pop art can be traced back to the ideas of Marcel Duchamp, who suggested that art encompasses any activity. This perspective raises questions about the criteria by which certain activities are classified as art today, highlighting the notion that these classifications are socially constructed. \n\nIn \"The Invention of Art: A Cultural History,\" Larry Shiner explores the evolution of the modern art system, specifically the distinction between fine art and other forms of creative expression. He argues that the ancient Greek society did not have a term equivalent to \"art\"; instead, they used the word \"techne.\" This term encompassed a wide range of skilled human activities, including painting, sculpture, and music, as well as cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and farming. The contemporary distinctions between art and craft are thus viewed as historical constructs that emerged later in human history. \n\nOverall, the pop art movement and its subsequent developments reflect a complex interplay between cultural critique and the evolving definitions of art.", "sampled": "Pop art emerged as a significant movement in the mid-20th context, with artists such into Andy Warhol gaining prominence for their works that both celebrated and critiqued popular culture and the art world itself.
