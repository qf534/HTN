{"original": "In contemporary discussions of art, the marker of status has shifted from ownership to understanding the work itself. This evolution suggests that engagement with art is increasingly seen as an upper-class activity. The advent of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s provided artists and the gallery system with a significant tool for managing the distribution of video and computer artworks. This technology enabled the sale of limited editions to collectors, thereby enhancing the control artists have over their work.\n\n\nArt has historically been a source of controversy, often eliciting strong reactions from viewers for various reasons. Many pre-modern controversies are poorly documented or have been lost to contemporary understanding. \n\n\nAdditionally, art has faced criticism for its portrayal of unpopular figures, political parties, or groups. Artistic conventions, often upheld by critics, can be conservative and rigorously enforced, although public reception may vary. The iconographic content of artworks can also provoke controversy, as seen in late medieval depictions of the Swoon of the Virgin during the Crucifixion of Jesus.", "sampled": "In contemporary discussions of art, the marker of status has shifted from ownership to understanding the work itself.
