{"original": "In economic theory, a market player is characterized by a choice set denoted as \\( X_N := \\Delta \\), which represents the set of possible price vectors.

When the supply of a commodity exceeds its demand, the right-hand term in the utility function \\( U_N(y, p) \\) becomes negative, prompting the market player to set a lower price.
