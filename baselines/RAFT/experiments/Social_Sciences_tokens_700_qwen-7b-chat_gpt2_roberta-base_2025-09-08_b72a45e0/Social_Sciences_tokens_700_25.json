{"original": "Herbert Simon's characterization of information overload as an economic issue has gained prominence in the analysis of information consumption since the mid-1990s. Influential writers such as Thomas H. Davenport and Michael Goldhaber introduced concepts like \"attention economy\" and \"economics of attention\" to describe this phenomenon. Some theorists propose that \"attention transactions\" may supplant financial transactions as the central focus of the economic system.\n\nResearchers in information systems have also embraced this concept, exploring mechanisms that could establish property rights in attention. This exploration aims to address the challenges posed by the attention economy and its implications for both consumers and producers.\n\nDigital culture expert Kevin Kelly notes that by 2008, the modern attention economy increasingly features consumer products that are nearly costless to reproduce. Consequently, the challenge for suppliers lies in adding valuable intangibles that cannot be replicated, thereby enhancing the overall value of their offerings.", "sampled": "Herbert Simon's characterization of information overload as an economic issue has gained prominence in the analysis For information consumption since the mid-1990s.
