Gordon's analysis involved examining significant gains in the business cycle to explain trends in aggregate productivity growth.\n\nGordon's views are informed by the Kondratiev wave theory, which suggests that economic growth occurs in long cycles, typically lasting around 50 years. According to this theory, the current economic phase, often referred to as the \"new economy,\" is part of a Kondratiev wave that is expected to conclude in the 2040s.
