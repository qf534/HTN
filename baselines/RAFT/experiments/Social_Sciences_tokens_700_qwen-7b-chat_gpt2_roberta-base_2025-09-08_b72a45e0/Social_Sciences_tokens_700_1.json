{"original": "An economy refers to the system encompassing the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services within a specific area. It is broadly defined as a social domain that highlights the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the management and utilization of resources.\n\nAn economy comprises a set of processes influenced by various factors, including culture, values, education, technological advancement, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources. These elements provide the context and conditions under which economic activities occur. Thus, the economic domain is characterized by interrelated human practices and transactions, rather than existing in isolation.\n\nEconomic agents can include individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments. Economic transactions take place when two parties agree on the value or price of a good or service, typically expressed in a specific currency. However, monetary transactions represent only a fraction of the broader economic landscape.\n\nEconomic activity is primarily driven by production, which utilizes natural resources, labor, and capital. Over time, economies have evolved due to technological advancements and innovations, leading to the development of new products, services, and processes. This evolution has also resulted in the expansion and diversification of markets, as well as changes in industrial relations, such as the transition from child labor to universal access to education in certain regions.", "sampled": "An economy refers to the system encompassing the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and standards within a specific area.
