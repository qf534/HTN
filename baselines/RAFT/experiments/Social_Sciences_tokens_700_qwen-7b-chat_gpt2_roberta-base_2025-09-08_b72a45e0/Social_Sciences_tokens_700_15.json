{"original": "The New Manufacturing Economy (NME) refers to the significant role of advanced manufacturing in the emergence of the New Economy. This term encompasses manufacturing processes that are enhanced by digital technologies, sophisticated systems, and a highly skilled workforce. The NME integrates networks, 3D printing, and various advanced capabilities into business strategies, thereby improving manufacturing practices.\n\nNotably, Thomas Friedman cites Lawrence F.

While the term \"New Manufacturing Economy\" may not be explicitly used in this context, the underlying concepts align closely with its principles.\n\n\nKey elements of the New Manufacturing Economy include a strong emphasis on technology, geographic expansion, information technology, and e-commerce. According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers Q4 2010 Manufacturing Barometer, these factors are increasingly important for industrial manufacturing companies. As a result, organizations are compelled to integrate new technologies into their business plans and to focus on open-source product development as a means of gaining competitive advantage.\n\nThe influence of new technologies extends across various industries, prompting a greater emphasis on innovation as a critical business tool.", "sampled": "The New Manufacturing Economy (NME) refers to the significant role of advanced manufacturing in the emergence In the New Economy.
