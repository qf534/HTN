{"original": "In recent years, some economists have posited that traditional economic laws may no longer apply, suggesting that new principles have emerged in the context of a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

They contend that a considerable portion of these investments may not yield the anticipated returns. However, this assessment may overlook the broader context, as data indicates that U.S. investment in information technology has remained robust since 2002. While some instances of overinvestment may exist, research on productivity suggests that many investments have effectively contributed to enhanced output.\n\nThe recession of 2001 challenged several of the more extreme predictions made during the preceding economic boom, lending support to economist Robert Gordon's argument that the contributions of computers to productivity may have been overstated.
