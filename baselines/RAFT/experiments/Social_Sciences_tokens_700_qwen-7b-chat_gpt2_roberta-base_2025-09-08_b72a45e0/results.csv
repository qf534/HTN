The contemporary understanding of the term, referring to ""the economic system of a country or an area,"" began to emerge in the 1650s.


The concept of an economy has existed as long as humans have engaged in the production, supply, and distribution of goods and services. As societies evolved and became more complex, their economies expanded accordingly. 

One of the earliest examples of a large-scale economy can be traced to Sumer, which developed a system based on commodity money. Subsequently, the Babylonians and their neighboring city-states established foundational economic practices that resemble modern economic principles. They introduced rules and laws concerning debt, legal contracts, and business practices, as well as concepts related to private property.

The Babylonians were pioneers in creating codified legal and administrative systems, which included courts, prisons, and government records. The ancient economy primarily relied on subsistence farming. 

The term ""shekel"" is significant as it refers to both a unit of weight and currency used by Semitic peoples.

1,"An economy refers to the system encompassing the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services within a specific area. It is broadly defined as a social domain that highlights the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the management and utilization of resources.

An economy comprises a set of processes influenced by various factors, including culture, values, education, technological advancement, history, social organization, political structure, legal systems, and natural resources. These elements provide the context and conditions under which economic activities occur. Thus, the economic domain is characterized by interrelated human practices and transactions, rather than existing in isolation.

Economic agents can include individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments. Economic transactions take place when two parties agree on the value or price of a good or service, typically expressed in a specific currency. However, monetary transactions represent only a fraction of the broader economic landscape.

Economic activity is primarily driven by production, which utilizes natural resources, labor, and capital. Over time, economies have evolved due to technological advancements and innovations, leading to the development of new products, services, and processes. This evolution has also resulted in the expansion and diversification of markets, as well as changes in industrial relations, such as the transition from child labor to universal access to education in certain regions.","An economy refers to the system encompassing the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and standards within a specific area.

2,"The onset of the Industrial Revolution represents a significant turning point in human history, profoundly influencing nearly every aspect of daily life. In Europe, the emergence of capitalism began to supplant the mercantilist system, which is often associated with protectionist policies, leading to notable economic growth. This period is termed the Industrial Revolution due to the advancements in production methods and the division of labor, which facilitated the mass production of goods.

The contemporary understanding of ""the economy"" gained prominence during the American Great Depression of the 1930s. In the aftermath of two World Wars and the severe economic downturn of the Great Depression, policymakers sought innovative approaches to manage economic stability. This discourse included the ideas of economists such as Friedrich August von Hayek (1899–1992) and Milton Friedman (1912–2006), who advocated for global free trade and are often regarded as foundational figures of neoliberalism.

Conversely, the prevailing economic perspective during this period was championed by John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946). Keynes argued for increased state intervention in the markets, positing that government action could mitigate economic challenges and stimulate growth through the manipulation of aggregate demand.

He posited that products are offered at a natural price determined by competition, supply and demand, and the division of labor. Smith argued that the primary motivation for free trade is human self-interest, which became a fundamental principle in economic theory.

5,"The term ""barley/shekel"" historically referred to both a unit of currency and a unit of weight, similar to how the British Pound originally denoted a mass of one pound of silver. In ancient societies, the exchange of goods predominantly occurred through social relationships, with bartering being a common practice in marketplaces.

In Ancient Greece, from which the modern term ""economy"" is derived, many individuals were bond slaves to freeholders. Economic discussions during this period were often influenced by the concept of scarcity. Chinese economic law introduced the idea that a non-market economy could foster institutional innovation, allowing firms to maintain a legally protected tenure, shielded from bureaucratic exploitation.


During the Middle Ages, the economy was largely characterized by subsistence-level exchanges, primarily occurring within social groups. Notably, great conquerors sought what is now referred to as venture capital—derived from the Italian word ""ventura,"" meaning risk—to fund their military campaigns. The expectation was that the capital invested would be repaid through the goods acquired from newly discovered territories.

7,"Economic systems can be categorized into various types based on their structure and functioning. 

A market economy is characterized by the production and exchange of goods and services driven by supply and demand. Participants, known as economic agents, engage in transactions either through barter or by using a medium of exchange, such as currency. Prices in a market economy are determined by the interactions of buyers and sellers.

In a planned economy, the government or political agents exert control over the production, distribution, and pricing of goods and services. This system aims to allocate resources according to a predetermined plan rather than through market forces.

A green economy emphasizes low carbon emissions and resource efficiency. In this model, economic growth and job creation are fostered through public and private investments that aim to reduce pollution, enhance energy efficiency, and preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The gig economy is defined by short-term, flexible jobs that are often facilitated through digital platforms. Workers in this economy typically engage in on-demand tasks rather than traditional, long-term employment.

The global economy encompasses the interconnected economic systems of countries around the world. It reflects the collective economic activities and interactions among nations.

The informal economy consists of economic activities that are not regulated or taxed by the government. This sector includes a wide range of activities, from street vending to unregistered businesses.


The evolution of economies can be understood through several historical phases:

1.    The ancient economy primarily relied on subsistence farming, where communities produced just enough to meet their basic needs.

2.    The industrial revolution marked a significant shift from subsistence farming to more extensive and mono-cultural agricultural practices. This period also saw substantial growth in mining, construction, and manufacturing industries, which played a crucial role in economic development over the last three centuries.

Proponents of this view argue that advancements in computer hardware and software are poised to significantly reshape the future economy, with information emerging as a critical asset in this new paradigm.

Notable economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Blake Belding, have expressed skepticism regarding the efficacy of substantial investments in information technology, particularly in areas such as software development and underutilized fiber optic networks. They contend that a considerable portion of these investments may not yield the anticipated returns. However, this assessment may overlook the broader context, as data indicates that U.S. investment in information technology has remained robust since 2002. While some instances of overinvestment may exist, research on productivity suggests that many investments have effectively contributed to enhanced output.

The recession of 2001 challenged several of the more extreme predictions made during the preceding economic boom, lending support to economist Robert Gordon's argument that the contributions of computers to productivity may have been overstated.

In this context, individuals encounter various items of information, selectively attend to specific ones, and subsequently decide whether to take action based on that information. 

A key aspect of attention economics is its recognition of the limitations of human cognitive capacity. The ability to process information is constrained, meaning that individuals can only engage with a finite amount of data at any given time. This selective attention enables individuals to filter information, allowing them to extract the most pertinent details from their environment while disregarding irrelevant content.

In practical applications, software developers often incorporate principles of attention economics into user interface design. This is based on the understanding that if users struggle to locate information quickly, they may turn to alternative applications. To enhance user experience, developers create filters that present information tailored to users' interests and preferences, often informed by their previous online behavior. This personalization aims to ensure that users receive the most relevant and engaging content, thereby optimizing their attention and engagement.","Attention economics is a framework for managing information that views human attention as a limited resource.

24,"In economic theory, the concept of compensated equilibrium is crucial for understanding agent preferences and resource allocation. A compensated equilibrium maintains the same feasibility and budget conditions as a standard equilibrium but modifies the preference condition.


For every agent \( i \) and for every bundle \( z \in Y_i \), if the agent strictly prefers bundle \( z \) to their current allocation \( y_i \) (denoted as \( z \succ_i y_i \)), then the following condition must hold:

\[
p \cdot z \geq p \cdot y_i
\]

This indicates that if an agent prefers bundle \( z \), they must be able to afford it, allowing for the possibility of indifference.


A Pareto-optimal allocation is defined as an allocation where no further improvements can be made without making at least one agent worse off. A Pareto improvement occurs when an alternative allocation \( y' \) is strictly better for a subset \( J \) of agents while leaving the allocations for all other agents unchanged. Formally, this can be expressed as:

\[
\sum_{i \in J} y_i' > \sum_{i \in J} y_i
\]

In summary, the principles of compensated equilibrium and Pareto optimality are essential for analyzing agent preferences and ensuring efficient resource distribution within an economy.","In economic theory, the concept of compensated equilibrium is crucial for understanding agent preferences and resource allocation.

25,"Herbert Simon's characterization of information overload as an economic issue has gained prominence in the analysis of information consumption since the mid-1990s. Influential writers such as Thomas H. Davenport and Michael Goldhaber introduced concepts like ""attention economy"" and ""economics of attention"" to describe this phenomenon. Some theorists propose that ""attention transactions"" may supplant financial transactions as the central focus of the economic system.

Researchers in information systems have also embraced this concept, exploring mechanisms that could establish property rights in attention. This exploration aims to address the challenges posed by the attention economy and its implications for both consumers and producers.

Digital culture expert Kevin Kelly notes that by 2008, the modern attention economy increasingly features consumer products that are nearly costless to reproduce. Consequently, the challenge for suppliers lies in adding valuable intangibles that cannot be replicated, thereby enhancing the overall value of their offerings.","Herbert Simon's characterization of information overload as an economic issue has gained prominence in the analysis For information consumption since the mid-1990s.

26,"The ""market maker"" reduction described herein transitions from the exchange economy of Arrow-Debreu to the abstract economy of Debreu. This process can similarly be applied to the generalized exchange economy of Mas-Colell and the generalized abstract economy of Shafer-Sonnenschein. 

This reduction indicates that certain conditions are sufficient for the existence of competitive equilibrium within the generalized exchange economy:

1. Each preference relation \( \prec_i \) is relatively open, which is equivalent to stating that each preference ordering \( P_i \) has an open graph.
2. For every bundle \( x \), the set \( P_i(x) \) is convex and does not include \( x \) itself, demonstrating irreflexivity.
3. Mas-Colell introduced an additional condition that the set \( P_i(x) \) must be non-empty, ensuring non-saturation.
4. For each agent \( i \), the initial endowment \( w_i \) is strictly preferred to some bundle \( x_i \) (denoted as \( w_i \gg x_i \)), indicating that the initial endowment lies within the interior of the choice sets.


To illustrate the potential failure of equilibrium existence when the open graph property is not satisfied, consider an economy comprising two goods, such as apples and bananas. In this scenario, there are two agents with identical endowments of (1, 1). This example highlights the importance of the open graph condition in maintaining competitive equilibrium within the market.","The ""market maker"" reduction described herein transitions from the exchange economy of Arrow-Debreu to the abstract economy of Debreu.

27,"Long-term attention refers to the sustained focus individuals allocate to managing their interactions with others. Excessive attention to these interactions can result in ""social interaction overload,"" a phenomenon where individuals feel overwhelmed by the demands of maintaining relationships, particularly within the context of social networking services that generate high levels of social solicitations.

The rise of digital media and the internet has transformed the landscape of attention management, providing new avenues for distributing attention. Individuals are now empowered to reach broad audiences by creating and sharing their own content, as well as engaging with the content produced by others. This shift has also led to the concept of collective attention, which examines how attention to novel items spreads and eventually diminishes within large populations.

28,"In economic theory, \( P_i(a_i, b_i) \) denotes a complete and transitive relation. However, it is important to note that this relation does not possess an open graph, indicating that the economy in question lacks an equilibrium.

To explore this concept further, let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that an equilibrium exists. Under this assumption, the allocation for each agent must be lexicographically at least \( (1, 1) \). This implies that both agents' allocations must be precisely \( (1, 1) \). 

Two scenarios arise from this situation:

1.    If the price of bananas is set to zero, both agents can afford the bundle \( (1, 2) \), which is strictly preferable to their current allocation of \( (1, 1) \).

2.    If the price of bananas is denoted as \( p > 0 \) (with the price of apples normalized to 1), both agents can afford the bundle \( (1 + p, 0) \). This bundle is also strictly better than their allocation of \( (1, 1) \).

In both scenarios, the proposed price cannot constitute an equilibrium price.


The research conducted by Fon and Otani extends the welfare theorems to the generalized exchange economy as described by Mas-Colell. Their analysis is based on several key assumptions:

- Each consumption set \( Y_i \) is non-empty, convex, closed, and bounded below.
- The preference correspondence is non-empty, expressed as \( P_i(y_i)

29,"As the cost of transmitting advertisements to consumers has significantly decreased, particularly through online platforms, the ability to deliver a greater volume of advertisements than consumers can effectively process has emerged. Consequently, consumer attention has become a scarce resource that requires careful allocation. This phenomenon, often referred to as ""information overload,"" can impede decision-making, as individuals may continue to search for and compare products, driven by the potential for greater benefits than the costs incurred.

Critics have raised concerns regarding advertisers who create attention-grabbing content that is presented to consumers without their consent or compensation. This practice has been described as ""attention theft,"" highlighting the ethical implications of unsolicited advertising.


One approach to addressing the challenges posed by excessive information is to conceptualize various forms of information—such as spam and advertising—as a form of pollution or ""detrimental externality."" In economics, an externality refers to a consequence of an economic activity that affects other parties who did not choose to be involved in that activity. For instance, air and water pollution are considered negative externalities that impose costs on society and the environment.

A market-based approach to managing externalities was proposed by economist Ronald Coase in his seminal work, ""The Problem of Social Cost"" (1960). This concept evolved from Coase's earlier article on the Federal Communications Commission (1959), in which he argued that radio frequency interference represents a negative externality that could be mitigated through the establishment of property rights. By applying similar principles to information pollution, it may be possible to develop strategies that balance the interests of advertisers and consumers while minimizing the adverse effects of excessive information.","As the cost of transmitting advertisements to consumers has significantly decreased, particularly through online platforms, the ability to deliver a greater volume though advertisements than consumers can effectively process has emerged.
