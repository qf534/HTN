{"original": "In molecular biology, molecular chaperones are proteins that assist in the folding, unfolding, assembly, or disassembly of other macromolecular structures. Under typical conditions, these chaperones facilitate conformational changes in macromolecules in response to variations in environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and voltage. By reducing conformational flexibility, researchers can influence the function of specific proteins.", "sampled": "In molecular biology, molecular chaperones are proteins that assist in the folding, unfolding, assembly, or disassembly about other macromolecular structures.
