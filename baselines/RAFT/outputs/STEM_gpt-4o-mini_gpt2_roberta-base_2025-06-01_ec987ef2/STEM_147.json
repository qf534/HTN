{"original": "Muscle tissue retains its contractile properties regardless of the size of the animal. However, physiological scaling in muscles influences the number of muscle fibers and their intrinsic speed, which in turn affects the maximum power and efficiency of movement in different species. The speed of muscle recruitment is generally inversely related to the cube root of the animal's weight. For instance, the intrinsic frequency of a sparrow's", "sampled": "Muscle tissue retains its contractile properties regardless with the size of the animal.
