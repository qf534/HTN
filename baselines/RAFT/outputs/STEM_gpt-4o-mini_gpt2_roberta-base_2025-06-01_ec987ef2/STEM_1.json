{"original": "Amphibians possess a three-chambered heart, consisting of two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder, and their primary nitrogenous waste product is urea. Amphibians utilize buccal pumping for respiration, a process in which air is drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. The nostrils are then closed, and the air is pushed into the lungs by the contraction of the throat muscles.
