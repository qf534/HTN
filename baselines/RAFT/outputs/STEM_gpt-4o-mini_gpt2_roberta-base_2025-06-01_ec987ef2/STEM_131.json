{"original": "Hennig's Rule, named after the German entomologist Willi Hennig, posits an inverse relationship between water temperature and certain meristic characteristics in fish. Specifically, it suggests that as water temperature decreases, the number of fin rays, vertebrae, and scales tends to increase. This principle is significant in the study of ichthyology, the branch of zoology concerned with fish.\n\n\nJordan's Rule, named after the American ", "sampled": "Hennig's Rule, named after the German entomologist Willi Hennig, posits an inverse relationship between water temperature and certain meristic characteristics in fish.
