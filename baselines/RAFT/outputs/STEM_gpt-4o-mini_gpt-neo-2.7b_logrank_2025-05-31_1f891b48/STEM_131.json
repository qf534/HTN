{"original": "Hennig's Rule, named after the German entomologist Willi Hennig, posits an inverse relationship between water temperature and certain meristic characteristics in fish. Specifically, it suggests that as water temperature decreases, the number of fin rays, vertebrae, and scales tends to increase.
