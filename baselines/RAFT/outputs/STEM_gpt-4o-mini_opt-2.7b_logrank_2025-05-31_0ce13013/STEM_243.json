{"original": "Thorson's Rule posits that benthic marine invertebrates at low latitudes typically produce a large number of eggs that develop into pelagic larvae, which are often planktotrophic, meaning they feed on plankton. In contrast, at high latitudes, these organisms generally produce fewer but larger lecithotrophic eggs, which are yolk-feeding. These larger offspring may develop through viviparity or ovoviviparity, often involving brooding.
