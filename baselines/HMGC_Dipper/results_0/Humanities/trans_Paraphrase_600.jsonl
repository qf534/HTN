{"x": "In the latter half of the eighteenth century the style of painting, especially landscape painting, was affected by the political question of Schleswig-Holstein, a matter of great importance for the Danes and difficult for many outsiders to understand. C. A. Jensen, born in 1792, and active until 1870, was a prominent painter, who specialized almost exclusively in portraits. His works show many phases of Danish life, and a great many of them are very effective. Danish painting in the course of the nineteenth century continued to reflect many current events and problems, and showed a great variety of artistic tendencies, the result of changes of fashion in the art market, but also more conservative influences.", "sample_id": 248}

Damien Hirst, for example, is known for the sculptural conception of his works, which he generally leaves to the skilled workmen of the world.
