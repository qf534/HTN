        "The French method was adopted in the establishment of the Chilean Academy. The uniformity of the European Academy was its distinctive feature, a tendency in which all the art that was “true” was condemned to follow a certain course. The Chilean Academy, under the direction of the Frenchman Antonio Ciccarelli, undertook a serious attempt to produce a national style of painting, and the neoclassical aesthetic, above all, was favoured. Even though at that time in Spain the neoclassical style was by no means so refined as in France, in this country it was just a matter of time before it found its way into the canons of Spanish art.",

        "In the seventies the artist enlarged his work to a series of large and deeply engaging installations, bringing in a variety of materials such as metal, rocks, wooden rafters, ladders, and sawhorses.

The Drukpa Kargyu, which is a branch of the Kagyu school, is famous for its paintings of the ‘seventy-two saints’ of the ‘eighty-four spiritual leaders’, a tradition that goes back to the 8th century AD. The ‘seventy-two spiritual leaders’ are believed to be a lineage of incarnations of the Buddha, which is why it is known as the ‘Dharma wheel’ tradition.",
        "Later, Gilliam himself, and critics and art historians, agreed on the term ‘drap painting’ to describe the distinctive style, which consisted of a draping technique, and which was also called a ‘drap painting’, a ‘drape painting’ and a ‘situation’.

        "The theory of art as form arose in Kant's philosophy and was developed in the first decades of the twentieth century by Leo Tolstoy, philosopher Benedetto Croce and philosopher R. G.

        "It is no secret that art is subject to subjective influences, which in the case of collectors, play a very important part in their decision to buy a particular work of art. One such collector is Jeff Koons, a leading artist who came to prominence under the influence of Andy Warhol. He started as a broker and ended up with an extraordinary career.",
        "Since the Protestant Reformation, religious art in Denmark has suffered a serious decline, and for a long time the most celebrated portraits of the Danish royal family have been made by foreigners.

        "Both ancient history and archeological findings have confirmed that the Huns wore diadems made of gold or gold-plated metal. Scholar Otto Maenchen-Helfen states that a total of six known Hun diadems are known. The products of the Hun period are believed to have been made by the local population, and not by the Huns themselves. Of the Hun women, also some are known to have had head ornaments of the kind used by the Ancient Egyptians.",

        "Artistic portfolios are indispensable to the artist, as they enable him to show his versatility and to exhibit a number of different samples of his present work. An artistic portfolio, usually called a sketchbook, is a collection of the artist’s best work, and reveals his personal style and method. It also enables the artist to determine the value of his work by judging the opinions of others and to correct his work if necessary.",

        "École de Paris was coined in 1924 by André Warnod. It was a miscellany of diverse artists, many of whom were Jews. In his works, Golusion, The Black Banner (Judaica, 1907) and The Sewer, [10] he showed a tension between death and resurrection, a characteristic of Christian images.",
        "However, although this may seem to overlook the enormous achievements of humankind, both individual and collective, it is true that art has a singular ability to transcend the passing of time. The idea of art’s unique ability to endure is further developed in Chapter 16, where the author declares that “The highest form of art is ‘Universal Art’, which presents simple and easily understood emotions.",
        "Canadian artists have been able to combine, throughout the ages, the influences of the English, French, and American art; absorbed and rejected by the country, and at the same time its own national character, a richness of influences, which it is not possible to separate, have thus produced a rich tapestry of diverse sprinklings. The Church, in its time, favored in the early Canadian period, especially in Quebec, the work of artists who attached themselves to religious subjects, especially to religious history, religious destinies, and subjects of devotion. The aborigines, in the country that is now Canada, have produced works of art for thousands of years.",

        "Art-markets are like the housing market in that comparables are used in order to establish a price for an artwork. This has led to a new trend, a tendency toward the purchase of western art by Asian collectors. Western art is often seen as a more suitable security for the loan of money than other kinds of art, and it is this which has partly made this increase in popularity. It is these comparables that are used in order to establish the value of the artwork.",

        "In the year 1968, Joost Baljeu announced that the fourth dimension is indeed a sculptural dimension, which means the time dimension, and that “the artist, through a study of spatial dimension, must change the way he works on a plane surface in a 3D picture, which, as he puts it, a perspective and a logical dimension.” Other artistic trends have been able to make references to the fourth dimension, including Severini’s ‘Mesuration de l’Espace et 4ème Dimension’. Other movements, including Vorticism, have made allusions to the fourth dimension, though rarely with any practical effect.",
        "The history of Australian landscape painting begins in the 1840s, when several attempts were made to set up art exhibitions.

        "In order to escape the obtrusiveness of public regulations, it was necessary to conceal the synagogues from view, a precaution of the highest importance for the sanctity and safety of Jewish places of worship. The concealment of synagogues in Central Europe was not only in their design, but extended to the surroundings, as can be seen in cities like Dussels and Vienna. During the reign of Napoleon III the building of a synagogue in the country was made illegal.",
        "This period marked the beginning of social criticism in literature, a phenomenon that was less characteristic of the plastic arts of the time.

        "Theo van Doesburg, since 1915 in his lectures and writings, gradually develops art as a medium from the natural to the spiritual.

        "The modernists argued that the role of the architect should not be overemphasized. The painting should 'capture' the flatness of the architecture. In the De Stijl movement, the interrelation between painters and architects was put in the foreground, with the aim of obtaining the most artistic results. And that was where the followers of K1017 came in.",

Especially in the various branches of the arts, including music, dance, and theatre, the purpose of communication is particularly obvious.",

Recently, the list of these forms has been enlarged by critics and historians to include photography, cinema, comics, theatre, television, fashion, advertising, animation and video games.

An enthusiast for art, he and Ambrosio Giacometti brought the Jesuit church in Santiago de Chile to the status of the great center of European painting and the Jesuit church in the American continent. Among the works of the Jesuits which have been preserved until today are those in their churches, such as the frescoes of the San Francisco church in Santiago de Chile, the nativity of Saint Matthew, and the sacrificial paintings in the Jesuits’ barracks in New York.",
        "Following their ancient nomadic traditions, the Croatians preferred to avoid cities and settled in the surrounding countryside. They acquired a foothold on the island of Jadro in the Danube and are still living in that area. In the 7th century they, along with other Slavs and the Avars, migrated from eastern Europe to the Roman provinces of Pannonia, Dalmatia and Istria, where they still reside today.",
        "One of the most characteristic artistic manifestations of the Guatemalan national identity is the weaving of its textiles. The architecture of Guatemala, from the magnificent Brutalist work of the Miguel Angel Asturias Centre, finished in 1978, to the ancient pyramids of Tikal, dating from the 4th century, reflects the wealth of cultural influences which the country has had, and is evidence of its evolution and its long historical course. The textile industry is an important and venerable aspect of the culture of Guatemala.",
        "By the middle of the eighteenth century, the Belgian architect and cabinetmaker Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, who with his contemporaries, among others, Pau, Julien, Dufour and Dusart, established in the region of Brussels a school of Neoclassicism whose influence has spread to all of Belgium, and has been reflected in numerous works, in particular in the abbey of Gembloux and the château de Seneffe.",
        "It has been argued that the early Vedic religion was centred on worship of elemental forces. This focus on elemental forces was not suited to anthropomorphic representation. A number of artefacts have been found in the riverbeds, but not one with anthropomorphic figures. There are, however, a large number of stone objects from the later period.",
        "The traditional wood-carving, or 'Parzo' is a special art form in its own right, and has evolved with modern architecture. Vegetable-dyed paper is a special kind of paper produced in the country for special occasions. The natural colours of vegetables are used in its manufacture, which makes for a unique product that is kind to the environment. Wooden flags are carved out of a single block of wood and carved like a camel. These are a prominent feature of the terraces.",
        "Most of the paintings mentioned in the historical texts (for example, the portraits of the Trpimirovich family in the church of St. George in Putalj near Katel Suurac, which no longer survive, are an early example of pre-Romanesque Croatian painting), were in most cases a painting of bright colors, red, blue and yellow. In some cases, the Croatian ornament was an architectural art.",
        "The National Institute of Zorig Chusum is the most prestigious art school in Thimphu. In addition to painting, the institution offers four- to six-year courses in the study of various types of traditional art. The word zhi means agate, especially when it is carved into a bead. The word rig means copper. It is said that the first zhi from agate zhi was brought to the Land of the Thunder Dragon by the local people.",
        "Hispaniola, or Quisqueya, in the language of the aborigines, and Hispaniola in Spanish, has a history of art which may be divided into three main periods: pre-Hispanic or aborigine, between 500 B.C. and 1500 A.D.; the period of the Spaniards or the Spanish period, from 1501 to 1821; and the Dominican period, from 1844 to the present day.",
        "And it is in this sense that all artists, painters, sculptors, architects, musicians, writers, sculptors, and the like, are able to give a sense of the complexity of life. This expression is not accidental; each work of art is the expression of a purpose. It is the expression of a new image. A painting, a sculpture, a building, a music, a book, is always the result of an idea of the artist.",
        "Early one morning in February 1893, a curious picture had been discovered in the park in the basement of a monument to the fallen Col. Mortier. It was at the foot of a statue in memory of the colloquist. In the late nineteen century, the press in the capital circulated a certain number of articles which evoked a vivid sentiment of discontent. The students of Professor Desangles were thus inspired to compose some drawings and paintings on a rough and dangerous theme, and they treated the subject of an execrated dictator, President Heures, in several compositions.",
        "Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543), a painter whose portraits and religious works have a good reputation, was one of the earliest of the 'little masters,' a group of engravers, distinguished by the number and skill of their miniaturized and exquisitely executed engravings, aimed at a wealthy middle-class market, and known for their erotic subject-matter.",
        "The only known ship grave is in Ladbyskifte. Danish places have contributed significantly to the development of Viking or Norwegian art, with two of the six main styles, the Jelling style and its successor, the Mammen style. These styles are predominant, but other artistic styles are also represented in Denmark. Jelling style is best known for its metal ornaments and brooches.",
        "His considerable work on the cathedral was carried on by his pupils, Andrej Alei and Nikola Firentinac. The latter did his part in the building of the cathedral and consolidated it with the help of his theory. Then began in 1468 the enlargement of the chapel of St. John of Trogir, within the presbytery, at a cost of four hundred ducats.",
        "Newer artists have come to be interested in the intersection of new and old media. In the 20th century, Pablo Picasso and Graham Sutherland, a series of important artists, have had a great influence on Colombian art. Today, Fernando Botero and Omar Rayo have achieved great success. Their works often reflect the conflict that afflicts Colombia.",
        "In the realm of conceptual art, the key figures are Bernd and Hilla Becher, Hanne Darboven, Hans-Peter Feldman, Hans Haacke and Charlotte Posenenske. As an artist, sculptor and theorist, Joseph Beuys is one of the most influential. The name of artists such as Martin Kippenberger, Gerda Richter, Sigmar Polke, Neo Rauch and many others is mentioned in connection with the usual artistic means and representational depictions.",
        "Saint Veit Stoss died in 1533, Tilman Riemenschneider in 1531, and Peter Vischer the Elder in 1529. All three of them were contemporaries of Albrecht Dürer and with them and others like them were active through the transition from Gothic to Renaissance. In the predominantly Catholic south of Germany, the Gothic tradition of sculpture remained alive and was in constant flux, keeping up with the shifting of artistic styles and evolving over the centuries.",
        "As a result, it is now a museum. Ahsan Manzil is one of the finest Mughal-era buildings in Dhaka, once the abode of the Nawabs of Dhaka. This, with the other monuments of the time, was completed in 1817, and today, it is a museum. It is a fine example of the style of the time, and a major tourist attraction. In modern times, however, the architectural scene in Bangladesh has evolved into an amalgamation of many styles, including Bengali and European styles.",
        "Art historians often regard the decade of the twenties as a crucial one, when Colombian painting began to develop a distinct point of view. During the decade of the forties, a falling off in the international interest in Colombian art, influenced by this, a great many artists of Colombia sought to renew their work in various forms of impressionism and French academic art. The painter Ricardo Gómez Campuzano, a landscape painter of Cartagena, was a notable figure of this period.",
        "The Polynesians are said to have settled in Hawai'i between one and two thousand years ago. In 1778, James Cook was the first European to visit the island, which he named the Sandwich Islands. The archipelago of the Hawai'i islands, consisting of 137 islands, is very far from any continent. The natives, very fond of carving, adorn their houses and caves with beautiful objects made of green schist. The art of the Hawai'ians can be divided into three periods: the pre-Christian period, the Christian period and the modern period.",
        "Beginning with the Jesuits and the local artisans, the artistic movement was based on the fusion of European styles, primarily the  mand and the baroque, with native arts and customs. This fusion of European and indigenous styles began in the middle of the seventeenth century.",
        "The oldest known picture in Europe is the 'Rhino-knuckle' of the Einhorn cavern, which dates from the time of the Neanderthals and is ascribed to them. A number of drilled shells, which date from about 75,000 years ago, have been found in a South African cave; and we know of containers for paint, which may date from as long ago as a hundred thousand years. These containers were a means of preparing the pigments, and the fact that the objects had been made in a small quantity, at least, is no reason to doubt that the art was created by the same hand which fashioned them.",
        "The genesis of medieval art in Germany is intimately connected with the history of the Frankish Empire under Charlemagne (d. 804), the first ruler to rule over a large part of the territory that is now Germany. The non-Romanized regions of the Roman Empire are to be classed under the early art of the Migration Period, the most striking feature of which is the metal-work, especially the jewelery, the large pieces of which were more commonly worn by men.",
        "The concept of the nobility of country life, and its connection with the past, reflects the artists’ love of European motifs and mythology. By the 1890s, when the majority of Australians, including the majority of artists, were living in the cities, a romantic ideal of the life of the pioneer, of the individual’s efforts to establish himself, made the genre of the Heidelberg School one of the most popular.",
        "In addition to temples, the great palaces, the mansions of the rich and aristocratic, often permitted the public to visit certain of their sanctuaries. Egyptian temples are characterized by a great pomp and magnificence, which is more conspicuous in the parts which were open to the general public, as distinguished from the severe parts reserved for the use of the priests, and which were less accessible. These places were frequently open to the public, and their collections of art were often to be seen.",
        "During the 1970s, a few other American artists, such as Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Sam Gilliam, began to experiment with the possibility of going beyond the frame of the canvas and placing the work in the centre of the space.",
        "For the sake of elaborating a distinct style, each artist has his own standards. This style is the mark of his genius and the soul of his work, and this touch may be universally appreciated, or it may be related to a personal or a common period.",
        "The partition of India in 1947 divided Calcutta into the province of West Bengal, while the rest of the country became East Pakistan. It was during this time that artists of the city of Dhaka decided to found an academy for art.",
        "Sarajevo contains an important collection of Muslim manuscripts, and possesses one of the finest libraries in Europe. The Bazar dates from the 15th century, and is a crowded bazaar of all the bazaars.",
        "It is clear that this generation was deeply influenced by the French pointillism of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. A young adolescent painter, James Ensor, first tried his hand at impressionism before settling on his own style. He had studied the impressionists and could copy their technique.",
        "After the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, some artisans continued to produce traditional products, either to sell to tourists or to keep the culture alive. Before the arrival of the Europeans, the islanders had neither metal nor woven cloth. However, the native tradition was still alive. There were already professional and amateur artists who were present at the first European meetings.",
        "Winther worked with a variety of materials. He started out with canvas and mash. In his endeavour to simplify his art he reduced his colouring and started painting on cardboard. The series of paintings, the colouring and the overall design were the same as in the canvases. This sifting through the shades of the colours and the use of the white space is in its own way a shift from one artistic medium to another.",
        "At this time, all the major clothing and shoe shops, as well as the famous fashion houses, published their own artist design books, in which you could see their products. The artist design books, especially the digital versions, are often called “fashion diaries”. Fashion diaries are often published by bloggers, sometimes daily or weekly, and they show the new fashions and styles. There is also a web-diary.",
        "In Cambodia, as elsewhere, the art is a national production. The Khmer Empire (802-1431) was the most important period, especially for the art of the Angkor region. It was in the 10th century that the Angkor Wat temple was built and from that time on it was gradually converted to Buddhism.",
        "In 1680, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, also known as ‘the Founder of Religious Administration’, ordered the establishment of a school dedicated to the teaching of the 13 kinds of classical art. Although some of these arts had been known to the country even before that, it was Pema Lingpa, a great tertön of the 15th century, who was credited with the establishment of religious art in the country.",
        "The drawing is on a rectangle of orange-red chalk paper, 2 138 x 2 138 inches, and it is numbered 213 in the Melzi collection. It is a study for the draped arm of the Virgin in the Annunciation.",
        "The creation of an aesthetic experience requires intention, which is a factor normally associated with an agent—the artist. Although beauty and the aesthetic emotions it can produce are generally considered to be intrinsic to nature, it should be noted that in itself nature does not produce aesthetic emotions. This is demonstrated by the famous aesthetician Monroe Beardsley: “It is only by a relationship with art that we can understand what art is.”",
        "Heidegger claims that art not only expresses, but also creates, truth. In his article “The Beginning of the Work of Art,” the great German philosopher Martin Heidegger examines the very essence of art through the concept of being. Heidegger claims that art is not simply representational, but rather performative, in that it is not merely an expression of truth.",
        "According to the philosopher Morris Weitz, the nature of art, the evolving nature, with its perpetual change and innovation, makes it impossible to restrict it to a purely classical definition, which seeks a strict definition of art. In the determination of whether a new work of art is art or not, we must decide whether to expand the criteria for art.",
        "It is precisely this careful preparation and presentation of their art that is a major part of their creative work. For example, they have used new media to deal with the issue of sovereignty, national identity, freedom and democracy.",
        "With the growth of the caravan trade, the growth of the cities, the trade in handicrafts, a certain set of peoples in the great cities began to be famed, and some were famous for weaving rugs, making jars, and producing silver and gold articles. And thus the development of trade in this region, which is now called Azerbaijan, was greatly aided by the establishment of towns. A great deal of archeological material has been found there.",
        "The last point in the definition of Gaut is that it can accommodate certain smaller clusters of less than nine criteria which might also be acceptable as criteria of art. Gaut’s criteria for art include ‘having aesthetic value’ and ‘expresses emotion’ (p. 28). Neither of these criteria is in itself sufficient for an art-like quality but they are merely subsets of the overall framework of ten criteria which, taken together, determine art-like status.",
        "In many of the contemporary theories of art, it is argued that the aesthetic definitions of art are of limited extension, especially in the case of the works created after Marcel Duchamp. Some scholars find the answer to the various theories of art inadequate, for it either presupposes or makes an arbitrary distinction between the works and the commentary on the works. Consequently, many of these theories are mutually exclusive.",
        "And it can be said that the “Dumroes” in Dubrovnik are on the whole Gothic and Romanesque; in the lower cloister is a mixture of the old and the new architecture. It was founded by Mihe Brajkov in 1360. The majority of the original edifice was destroyed in the 1667 earthquake; the monastery remained, however, the same, and some of the parts of the original building, such as the beautiful carved portal of the church, were preserved. It is decorated in the Romanesque style with lively carved decorations.",
        "THERE IS NO ONE who has studied the old history of Cambodia, which dates from the thirteenth century, who did not learn from the customs and usages of the Khmers of the country. There is no one, who has not read the description of the latter written by the Chinese diplomat, Zhou Daguan. According to the latter, their art of weaving was not advanced, as they did not use the loom.",
        "It is a rich and national art, based on craftsmanship; it consists of chasing (working with metal), jewellery-making, engraving, wood-, stone- and bone-carving, weaving, carpet-making, needlework, embroidering, embossing, embossing, painting, felt-making, leather-working and embroidery.",
        "In the beginning of the twelfth century Early Romanesque art was beginning to take its course in Croatia, and with the establishment of the order of St. Benedict from Monte Cassino, two churches were built, one in Split, dedicated to St. Benedikta, later called St. Euphemia, and the other at Zadar, dedicated to St. Mary.",
        "These movements and artists make up a distinctly Danish art history with its characteristic mixture of classic themes and new expressions. Among the best-known artists are those who have distinguished themselves by their contribution to portraiture and historical painting. A famous example is The Mothers...",
        "The New Art or Nazareth, a word that was first used in the 18th century by a critical writer, was a reaction against Neoclassicism and the standard methods of the academy. The Nazareth, they said, were artists who had found spiritual and moral truth in the medieval art.",
        "In 1964 the art critic and philosopher Arthur Danto published his influential work “The Art World” in which he questioned the relationship between art theory and the perception of art. Market values are used for various purposes, including taxation, donations, and inheritance tax. Recently, however, sales prices have often exceeded these estimates, indicating a shift in the dynamic of the art market. A sample of current estimates is provided in the second chapter of the book.",
        "The Gothic style was born in Hungary in the late fourteenth century and was popular in the fifteenth century under the reigns of the Anjou, Luxembourg and Jagello dynasties. The main squares of many rich mining towns, such as Kassa (today's Koice, Slovakia), Bartfa (today's Bardejov, Slovakia), Brassó (today's Brasóv, Romania) and Nagyszeben (today's Sibj), were built in that style, which was also reflected in the renovation of several medieval monasteries, such as Vajkoz, and at the Vajkozy.",
        "In the first year of the festival, Baku Open Art, a festival of modern art, was held. The symbol of Baku, the tower was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2000. In the framework of the event, the world of art was presented to the general public.",
        "In the latter half of the eighteenth century the style of painting, especially landscape painting, was affected by the political question of Schleswig-Holstein, a matter of great importance for the Danes and difficult for many outsiders to understand. C. A. Jensen, born in 1792, and active until 1870, was a prominent painter, who specialized almost exclusively in portraits. His works show many phases of Danish life, and a great many of them are very effective. Danish painting in the course of the nineteenth century continued to reflect many current events and problems, and showed a great variety of artistic tendencies, the result of changes of fashion in the art market, but also more conservative influences.",
        "The exhibition Derrame Cono Sur. o El viaje de los argonautas was opened in October 2005, and had as its focus the Chilean surrealist movement. The most outstanding figure is Roberto Matta, who had already been established in the world of art, and whose work had a strong influence on the international reputation of Chilean surrealism.",

Those cases are an integral part of the jurisprudence of art and art commerce in the United States, determining the responsibilities of taxpayers, appraisers, and consumers in the art market.",
        "Extreme intentionalism is generally held to be limiting, as works of art may embody a multiplicity of meanings, the intentions of the artist may be unknown or irrelevant, and there is no essential connection between the art and the life of the artist. Philosophical discussions about the nature and interpretation of art have often been interwoven with the concept of the God beyond time and space.",
        "The term \"anti-art\" designates works of art that intentionally infringe and violate the norms and values of the art world. “Cultural Interpretation” is a theory based on the hypothesis that an object’s artistic value, often called its artfulness, is created by the cultural environment and by interpretations of art. This theory emphasizes that the meaning and appreciation of art is based on cultural interpretations and by culture. Culture, especially art, is a derivative of culture.",
        "Today, both art and aesthetics, as the result of the cultural and philosophical ideas that began to shape themselves at the turn of the nineteenth into the twentieth century, are subject to the complex ideas of culture and philosophy that are often contradictory, they are sometimes a part of the rationalism of the Enlightenment, and they are often a more subjective experience, and aesthetics is the result of a variety of trends that have been introduced since the beginning of the twentieth century, at the same time as the multifarious forms of art that have appeared during the twentieth century.",
        "It was the epoch of the splendour of the free cities of Dalmatia, which traded with the feudal lords of Croatia. The development of the cities of Dalmatia may be traced from the constant growth and development of towns like Rab and Trogir. The Gothic art of the 14th century was the offspring of the cultural structure which was supported by the Council of the towns, the Franciscans and the nobles of the locality.",
        "In 1930, Trujillo, who took over the Dominican Republic, took the high art of painting under the hand of Don Manuel Fernández, and was the leader of the group of the oil-painters of the colony. From 1889, when he became the Dominican art minister, the art in the country was regulated by the State in the name of the Republic of the Dominican Republic.",
        "The Quito School had its beginnings after the Conquest of the New World, when Quito was visited by a great number of European artists. It soon acquired an eminent position, and spread to all the Spanish possessions in America. The founders of the school were the Franciscans. Its most eminent representative is the painter de Salomo.",
        "They have long been distinguished by the acclamation of a world of visitors from Tahiti, who buy them, as they are known, the finest of all the palms, for they are made from the fibre of the cocoa-nut palm. Their flowers are coloured, and their chaplets embroidered, with an admirable handicraft. Many islands have the opportunity of acquiring the shells for these cloisonnés, and their collectors do not fail to make their purchases.",

The film is entitled Capernaum, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Nadine’s film ‘Salam’ was screened at the Berlin film festival in February of the same year.",
        "In contemporary art, production usually takes the form of bringing together found objects, a practice which is a hallmark of the conceptual movement. Damien Hirst, for example, is known for the sculptural conception of his works, which he generally leaves to the skilled workmen of the world. His fame in the art world is greatly due to his power to invent controversial concepts. This said, a great many modern and contemporary artists have continued to work, with their hands.",
        "The artist said that his work is more influenced by an emotional response to nature than by the desire to depict particular elements of it. During the late years of the twentieth century, there was a tendency towards landscapes as the subject of paintings in Icelandic art, which was largely overshadowed for some years by the abstract expressionists.",
        "Among the principal artistic forms are architecture, painting, sculpture, and goldsmith work, with a number of varied kinds of embroidery. Ethiopian art is based on the spiritual civilization of this people, which developed in its present form in a state of semi-isolation from the rest of the African continent.",
        "As a piece commissioned by the Guggenheim, it aims to introduce people to the issues of technological development, industrialization, militarization, and essence. The main role of this Xu Xiaoer is to use a mechanical arm that dances in space to pick up the red etheric fluid that seeps out of its interior, so that it echoes with the inner red etheric fluid that escapes from the artificial seal. Isn't this a kind of technological warfare?",
        "Joseph Anton Koch, born in the Austrian Tyrol, has made a name for himself as a landscape painter of a Continental type, specialising in mountainous scenery. Carstens’s career was a stormy one, and he left several unfinished works. However, his pupils and friends went on to be a great influence. Among them were Gottlieb Schick, Joseph Anton Koch and Bonaventura Genelli.",
        "Art is not only a means of personal expression, but is a means of communication to the community. Research has shown that most art students consider reflection a crucial part of the artistic process. Art education journals have been promoting reflection as an integral part of the artistic experience. discussions have been about the perceived quality of the reflections of the art students.",

        "François Baillairgé was one of the leaders of this generation. After studying sculpture in London and Paris, he came back to Montreal in 1781. Portraiture, which acquired an important place in the art of this time, showed great variability and innovation. Among the artists of Lower Canada, influenced by the Rococo style which favoured a carefree, light, undisturbed style, Baillairgé, in contrast, selected a neo-classical style.",
        "In June, 1877, he came to Moscow and rented an apartment in a small street near the Transfiguration Church, on Durnovskoye Shosse (now Glinka Street), and it is said that during that summer he worked on his pictures ‘The Moscow Yard’ and ‘The Grand Staircase’.1 During the Crimean War, Vasily Polenov visited the field of battle, and drew several sketches in the impressionist manner, inspired by his experiences on the field.",
        "The progress of the civilization of the age, especially during the last century, was accompanied by a diffusion of art and artistic ideas that gave rise to numerous influences. Impressionism, expressionism, fauvism, cubism, dadaism, surrealism, all of which emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the outlines of these movements cannot be maintained to the end.",
        "Many of the early sketches of Australian fauna and flora were made by the artists attached to the ships that brought explorers to the continent in the first half of the nineteenth century. These illustrations are chiefly in the style of naval draughtsmanship, and are mainly of birds, while some show views of the infant colony. The Port Jackson painter is the most remarkable of these unknown artists.",

        "The dispersed and disjointed art market in Germany, with so many small states, has influenced the careers of major artists. The first German academy was founded in Berlin in 1696, and throughout the following two centuries various German cities followed a parallel development, with the results in the rest of Europe. In this way many artists of the time, in particular several among the Old Masters, acquired a considerable following in Germany.",
        "In the same way as we now have the Sporting Club of Beirut, the Hekmeh-Sagesse (hereafter Hekmeh-Sagesse), and the Sagesse de St-Eugène in Beirut, all these clubs represent their country in the different sports. The Lebanon national team plays in the Home International tournament. Antranik SC has distinguished itself in women’s basket-ball. * These clubs have greatly contributed to the development and spread of sport in the country.",
        "The conquerors saw the work of crafts and artisans as humiliating and contrary to their ideas of nobility, and so they entrusted it to mestizos. Painting in Chile, as in all Latin America, was influenced by Spanish art in several ways, including the study of human anatomy, the use of chiaroscuro, and the portrayal of aristocratic dress.",
        "The diagnostic drawing series is a clinical method for assessing personality and emotional functioning. Unlike most of the usual psychoanalytic methods, the aim of the DDS is not the final art produced, but the healing process brought about by the art. The art, however, does not come in itself.",
        "The early paintings of religious history in Canada, especially of those by Canadian artists, often give little idea of the way of life in the new country; ex-votos on the other hand, produced for the devotion of the sacrament, furnished striking proofs of it. Le Ber’s work is of the greatest importance, and his portrait of Saint Marguerite Bourgeoys is generally regarded as the most moving picture which remains of the French period.",
        "In this period, many a porcelain factory was founded by royal authority, and not many have lasted to the present day; but the Copenhagen porcelain factory was founded by royal authority and was continued as part of a large manufacturing organization. In this group it is now to be included also Kosta Glasbruk, founded in 1742 by two army officers, and Orrefors Glassworks, founded in 1898. Both have gained international renown.",
        "During this period, some of the principal aspects of the previous identity of Chilean art, such as pre-Columbian art, the socially edifying and cohesive effect of colonial art, and the eclecticism of art nouveau, were swept away. In 1869, after two decades of teaching, the Italian was replaced by the German artist Ernesto Kirchbach, who brought a very strict academic system of teaching, based on romanticism.",
        "Dealers, interested in the prosperity of their artists, are accustomed to bid for their artists’ works at public auctions. This is to prevent a fall in the price, to maintain it or to raise its reputation. This influences, in its way, the price of a living artist’s work in the first market. Dealers therefore act as if they had nothing to do with the artists whose works they buy at auction, and so the prices are manipulated by them.",
        "On the mainland, the Illyrian tribes began to organize their own centers, and the Hellenistic culture of the Greek enclaves began to affect the Illyrian art of the common people. The Hellenistic culture of the Greek enclaves was juxtaposed with the late Iron Age culture of the common Illyrian population. Life of the Greek colonists was largely secluded from the surrounding population, except for the interchange of influences from trade and warfare.",
        "In addition to the aforementioned, among the distinguished Croatian artists who have lived and worked abroad in the Renaissance, we have to mention the two brothers of the sculptor Francesco (Franjo Vranjanin) and Lukic (Luka Vranjanin), as well as the Italian painter Giulio (Francis) Lodolo and the great Renaissance painter and architect Girolamo (Julius) Lodolo, the grandson of Bernardo Giordano, who lived in Florence and died in the year 1482. His works are kept in the most important galleries and his name is connected with the greatest artists of the Renaissance.",
        "Though the members of the XIII Generation had diverse aesthetic and esthetic tastes, they were contemporaries and knew each other's works; Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma and Pedro Lira are often classified as naturalists, while Alberto Rojas belongs to the modernist movement. It is the first group or movement of Chilean art.",
        "This group of sculptors, painters and illustrators of the Republic, Leopoldo Navarro, Américo Lugo, Maximo Grollón, Arquimedes de la Concha, Angel Perdomo, Adolfo Garca Obregón, Alfredo Senior, Ramón Mella Leightgow, Adriana Billini, among others, represents a large generation of Dominican artists.",
        "After the definitive fall of the Empire in 1815, Bacler d'Albe had to face the impossibility of resuming his former activities, which included surveillance by the Restoration. He subsequently retired to his house at Sèvres, where he devoted himself to the lithographic art, making hundreds of reproductions of books and engravings, and painting hundreds of pictures.",
        "Two outstanding examples of medieval illuminated manuscripts from Bosnia are the Missionary Book of Hval and the Misal of Hrvoje Vukojevic Hrvatinic, a psalter associated with the Bosnian Duke and lord of Dalmatia, Hervoj Vukojevic Hrvatinic, which are today in the collection of the University of Zagreb and in the collection of the State Museum in Istanbul. The Missionary Book of Hval is in the collection of the University of Zagreb, and its miniatures have been preserved in the collection of the Zagreb School of Art, while the Misal Hrvojej Vukoia Hrvatinia, a prayer book with the head of Hermius, who was a bishop in Hrvata, is in the collection of the St. Catherine Church in the city of Dubrovnik in Croatia. The manuscript is characterized by a red background and yellow gold lettering on the left margin, and the miniatures on the right side are characterized by very small figures in different colors.",
        "The theory of the creation of art as developed by the philosopher Zangwill provides the background to a clear understanding of the process of artistic creation. Zangwill characterized this theory as an “artist-centred” one, in which the artistic personality takes a primary place. The development of architectural thought has been greatly influenced by its philosophical content. The process of creation is divided into three distinct phases: the first, according to Zangwill, is “receptive”; the second, the third, “productive.”",
        "In the northern Balkans, the ethno-tribal groups were divided along the border between the H-STT culture of the Celts and the Albanians. In the 7th century BC iron began to replace bronze as the main material for the manufacture of tools and utensils, but bronze continued to be used for jewelery and artistic objects.",
        "In fact, owing to the strategic position of the country at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, Georgia has been the recipient of numerous visitors, pilgrims, missionaries and merchants. Consequently, the ancient art of Georgia (Georgian: , “Georgian art”) developed in the course of the history of the country, and found a flourishing condition in the Middle Ages, especially in the realm of the Kingdom of Georgia.",
        "The bamboo craft, locally called thazo, is a popular craft, especially in rural parts of the country, where bamboo is used to make all kinds of products. In Thimphu, the Institute of Zorig Choekhor is preserving and promoting the traditional art forms. The most common products are the bamboo cane and basket, locally known as belo and bangchung.",
        "In the Caves and Caverns of the Caribbean, Taino art, with its primitive sculptures, its traces on the rocks, its petroglyphs, its pictographs, abounds. The great edifices of these petroglyphs, as the engravers call them, which also adorn the rocks with coloured drawings, testify to the antecedents of a people who are anthropophagic and religious, whose belief in spirits dates back nearly two thousand years. The distinction between Taino art and petroglyphs, engraved on the rocks, is, however, somewhat confused, and they appear at times to be but the traces of the tools which the workmen of the rocky massifs employed to impress their ideas on the rocks.",
        "In the Japanese art, it was deeply ingrained to consider a close connection between man and nature, in the face of the eternal interplay between the two. But the perception of ephemerality is very different from the perception of it in Western art, where ephemerality is often approached in a very different way than in some cultures, such as Japan, where the fleeting nature of life and its cultural manifestations is held in high regard. This close connection between the worlds, the divine and the human, can be found in Japanese works of art.",
        "In the year of Our Lord 965 and 970 was made in the Gero cross, which is now in Cologne Cathedral. It is a precious early medieval and life-like cross, the first of its kind, and the most beautiful of all near-life crosses of the time. Metal work at this time was regarded as the most exalted kind of art.",
        "In the 1920s, several Canadian artists, including Kathleen Munn, Bertram Brooker, and Lowrie Warrener, were trying out abstract or non-objective painting. The great Canadian painter Tom Thomson has become a myth, an important part of the Canadian nation. His many non-objective paintings influenced Canadian artists of the 1920s and 30s, although he was still the most prominent.",
        "The work is a kinetic sculpture, a mechanical arm, fitted with a shovel and a rubber squeegee. The arm is operated by a Kuka-controlled robot, and has full swiveling movements. At the centre of the work is a hydraulic unit, with a liquid consisting of methyl-ether, dyed dark red.",
        "Its renown began to be regarded, from the first, as independent of ancient Greek art. There were, however, certain features that it had which set it off. Its earliest origins can be traced to the antique Greek, a tradition which lasted, until 1453, and which was continued by Greek painters of the time of the French Revolution. In a word, it is an art which is exclusively divine in character. Its aim is, firstly, to glorify man, whereas classical art has for its aim the glory of man.",
        "The vulgar sciences are, in addition to these, architecture, sculpture, painting, and other arts that are now called a trade. The Liberal Arts are usually divided into two classes, the Trivium and the Quadrivium. The trivium is grammar, rhetoric, and logic; the quadrivium is arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. In the sixteenth century, there was a change in the order of learning.",
        "As such, most of the folk art created by women does not carry any commercial value. Consequently, it is the male folk artists—blacksmiths, potters, shoemakers, painters, goldsmiths, brasssmiths, and weavers—who earn their living from this art form. The folk art of Bengal is no exception. The products of the folk artisans are almost entirely village women.",
        "ART OF the Australian Caves, as far as age and quantity go, is at least as noteworthy as the Caves of Lascaux or Altamira. At Murujuga, in Western Australia, there are a number of rock-art paintings, which are among the best in the country. The Friends of the Australian Rock Art Association urged their preservation, and in 2007, UNESCO gave them the status of World Heritage. And in a certain sense, aboriginal art is also.",
        "Since the establishment of the German Empire in the 19th century, the definition of its borders has become increasingly complex, and is often highly contested. But German art as such has been a source of richness and fame in all the arts, from the time of the first figurative painting to the present day."
