{"x": "In some forms of life, the expression of a gene is regulated by epigenetic modifications of the chromatin. Chromatin is a complex of DNA and other constituents of the cell which can modify the action of a gene without altering its sequence. Structural genes code for structural proteins which are not responsible for the regulation of the gene. These genes are called transcribed.", "sample_id": 554}
{"x": "Two separate types of gamete — such as male and female gametes — unite to form a zygote. An organism thus enters the haplontic cycle when it comes to the end of its diploid phase and produces haploid cells. Haplotic cells are capable of dividing by mitosis, which results in multicellular organisms or new haploid cells. This cycle continues as long as the zygote is the only diploid cell and as long as mitosis occurs only in the zygote.", "sample_id": 555}
