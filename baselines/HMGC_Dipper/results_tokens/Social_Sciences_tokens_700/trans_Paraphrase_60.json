{"x": "An economy is a field of production, distribution, commerce, and consumption. In general, it is a social domain of activities, discourses, and material forms associated with the production, use, and management of resources. It is a social domain of related human practices and interactions which do not stand alone. Economic agents are individuals, corporations, organizations, and governments. The specific nature and context of an economy is determined by these factors. Economic activity is facilitated by production which uses natural resources, labour, and capital. Economic transactions occur when two groups or individuals agree on the value of a good or service. Usually, this value is expressed in a currency. In time, economies change due to technological and scientific innovations (new products, new services, new markets, new specialty markets, new ways of generating revenues), changes in labour relations (for example, the substitution of universal schooling for child labour).", "sample_id": 0}
{"x": "The present sense, in which the word is now used, ‘the system of commercial activity in a country or region’, does not seem to have been developed until the sixteenth century. The Latin word derives from the Greek oikonomia or oikonomos, the first element of which, oikos, signifies ‘house’ and the second, nemein, ‘to manage’. Among the Babylonians and the inhabitants of the neighbouring city-states, the earliest system of economics, based on debt, contracts and proprietary law, was later established. As long as people have been able to manufacture, supply and distribute goods and services, some form of economy has existed; economies have grown larger as societies have grown more complex. The first roots are to be found in Sumeria, which developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money; the Babylonians and the inhabitants of the neighbouring city-states then developed the earliest systems of economics, as we now understand them, based on debt, laws of contract, laws of proprietary law and law of private property. Shekel was the first word to designate both a measure of weight and a unit of money among the Semitic peoples. The earliest administrative system with courts, prisons and government records was also established by them. The ancient economy was based primarily on agriculture. The first word that bears this sense was employed in Mesopotamia in about three thousand B.C.", "sample_id": 1}

Originally, the shekel was both the unit of money and the unit of weight, as the British pound is the unit of a pound of silver. In Chinese economic law, the entire huge circle of institutional innovation consists of a single idea. In ancient Greece, the source of our English word “economy,” the majority of the people were serfs owned by their freeholders. Their economic debates were driven by scarcity. The Middle Ages. What we now call “economics” did not differ greatly from subsistence. Most exchanges were between social groups. To ensure non-market economies, the security of a fixed, legal job was paramount and protected from bureaucratic entrepreneurship. Later, when the great conquerors were financing their conquests, they would raise the capital we now call “venture capital,” from the Italian “ventura,” meaning “risk,” and would use this capital to buy up the goods of the new world. The first companies were trading houses. The first stock exchange was established in Antwerp in 1513. The discoveries of Marco Polo,1452—1324, Christopher Columbus,1451—1506, and Vasco da Gama,1469—1524, gave rise to the first worldwide economy. The European conquests were incorporated into European states, the so-called colonies. The “economy” then meant trade.", "sample_id": 2}
{"x": "In Europe, the decline of the Church had enabled the states to utilize the immense wealth of the Church for the building of cities. France, England, and Holland tried to control trade by tariffs; and mercantilism (from the Latin mercator, merchant) was the first attempt to reconcile private wealth with the public interest. In France, for example, bankers like Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1777–1855) had begun to finance the nation’s projects, especially the wars and the great building programs. The influence of the nobility was reduced. The first secretaries of state for finance were at work. The first economist in the modern sense was the Scotsman Adam Smith (1723–1790). He was inspired in part by the physiocrats, a reaction to mercantilism, and also by the economist Adam Mare, who was an advanced student of Smith. Smith defined the elements of a national economy: goods are offered at their natural price, as determined by competition and the division of labor. Henceforth, “economy” came to mean the economy of the nation state, that is, the economic activities of its citizens. The Englishman Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) extended the notion of supply and demand to the problem of overpopulation. He postulated that the basic motive for free trade is the well-being of the individual.", "sample_id": 3}
{"x": "The period known as the Industrial Revolution is so called because of the methods of production, distribution, and division of labour, which made possible the mass production of goods. In Europe the mercantilist system was superseded by the savage system of capitalism, which led to an enormous expansion of trade. The advent of the Industrial Revolution was a great turning point in human history, and it touched almost every aspect of life. Two world wars and the Great Depression resulted in an intensified search for new ways of controlling the direction of economic life, a quest that was explored and debated by Friedrich von Hayek (1899–1992) and Milton Friedman (1912–2006), who argued in favour of the open economy and were in this respect the fathers of neo-liberalism. The contemporary concept of economy did not acquire its modern name until the Great Depression in America in the 1930s. The theory that states can alleviate the economic situation and stimulate the economy through government intervention in the economy is known as the Keynesian policy after the name of the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946). The more prevailing view, however, is that of Keynes himself, who called for greater government intervention in the economy.", "sample_id": 4}

Since the economic miracle of the 'twenties, a new type of economy has arisen: the economy of mass consumption. Some have attributed the use of this word to the book of Daniel Bell from 1973 entitled The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, others to the social philosopher Ivan Illich's book entitled The Tools of Cooperation, the term has also been used in philosophy to designate the waning of postmodernism in the late twentieth century and, in particular, in the early twenty-first century. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the transition of the countries of the former socialist camp to democratic governments and market economies, the concept of post-industrial society was brought into focus, for its purpose is to demonstrate the significance that the service sector has taken over from industry.

It has long been the case that the study of the economy is divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics. In addition, a prevailing terminology is distinguished between indicators of the economy expressed in real terms (after correction for inflation), such as real GNP, and nominal ones (which are not corrected for inflation). The study of macroeconomics is primarily on the regional and national level and covers income and production, money and prices, employment, foreign trade and other issues.

{"x": "The common use of the term 'new economy' originated in the euphoria of the '90s, when high growth rates, low inflation, and high employment produced exuberant predictions and utopian business plans. The term is most often applied to the transition from a production-based to a service-based economy, and the rise of information technology. Since the 1970s, after more than twenty years of unbridled growth, there had been a long-standing and much discussed slowdown in the American economy, which was nicknamed the “stagnation” in economics. In a front-page article in Time titled \"The New Economy\" in a cover story from the same year, journalist Richard Thaler described the transition from heavy industry to a new economy, based on information technology. By 1997, Newsweek was referring to the \"new economy\" in many of its articles. From 1972 to 1995, the average annual growth in labor productivity had been only one percent, but in the mid-90s productivity had grown much faster, by 2.6% from 1995 to 1999. However, around the end of 1995, the American economy began to grow again, and it was the productivity growth that brought the economy back to life. According to the economist Robert J. Gordon, the American economy grew faster in the late '90s than in any time since World War II, the American unemployment rate was the lowest it had been in fifty years, and inflation was also low.", "sample_id": 11}

In the field of financial markets, the so-called dot-com bubble is closely associated with the rise of NASDAQ as a competitor of the New York Stock Exchange, the increase in the number of IPOs, the increase in the stock prices of dot-coms compared to established companies, and the popularity of tools such as stock options. Its innovation base is based on the Internet, nanotechnology, telematics and bionics.

They also said that the old laws of economics no longer applied, that new ones had been set up. But the recent crisis of the 2001–2 year confirmed that many of the extreme predictions of the \"golden years\" of growth had been disproved, and that many of the advances in information technology had not made a difference. The recent crisis of the year 2001 disproved many of the extreme predictions of the years of growth, and strengthened the view that the value of computers was negligible.

He named this game the generalized game of N persons and proved the existence of a general equilibrium.. Later, Arrow and Debreu used the existence result to prove the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium (known also as the competitive equilibrium) in the Arrow–Debreu model. But the most general case is the model of Debreu, where there is a finite number N of agents. For each agent i there exists: a set of choices Xi (a subset of some Euclidean space Rl) that corresponds to the global set of choices that he can make.

To this “market-maker” reduction from Arrow-Debreu to Debreu, one can now carry it to the generalized exchange economy of Mas-Collel to the generalized abstract economy of Shafer-Sonnenschein. The “market-maker” reduction that was used above to pass from Arrow-Debreu to Debreu to the generalized abstract economy of Debreu is now extended to the generalized exchange economy of Mas-Collel to the generalized abstract economy of Shafer-Sonnenschein.

On the other hand, if the price of bananas is some p > 0 (with a  1), then both agents can buy the bundle (1, p), which is strictly better than their allocation.

{"x": "Attention, says Matthew E. Crawford, is a resource, an individual has only so much of it. According to the two American authors, John C. Beck and Thomas H. Davenport, attention is “a concentrated mental effort directed at a particular item of information.” The attentional economy is an approach to information management that views human attention as a scarce resource and applies economic principles to a variety of information-management problems. Attention allows us to extract the most important information from the environment and disregard the unimportant details. When an object comes into our awareness, we attend to it, and then decide whether to act. One of the strong determinants of this phenomenon is that it limits the human brain’s capacity to handle information and the receiver’s ability to take it in. For example, by filtering out all the irrelevant information and presenting only what is important, in the form of personalizing and personalizing the viewer's previous searches. The attentional economy is an approach to information management that views human attention as a scarce resource and applies economic principles to solve various information-management problems.

{"x": "Theory Research from a variety of disciplines including psychology, cognition, neuroscience, and economics has suggested that a person has a limited amount of cognitive capacity which he can use at one time; if these resources are used for one task, the amount available for other tasks will be reduced. Given that attention is a limited mental resource that requires the selective concentration of mental resources on a particular stimulus, excluding other stimulus, we can understand attention as a limited resource. Erik Brynjolfsson, Seon-Tae Kim, and Joo-Hee Oh have argued that it is possible to analyze the attention economy formally, valuing the unpaid attention, and they have argued that this makes it possible to define the attention economy. The idea of an attention economy was first proposed in a report by economist and psychologist Herb Simon in a paper written in 1971. Simon had said that in an information-rich world, the presence of much information means that there is a shortage of something that the information consumes; the obvious thing to consume is the attention of the receiver; so the abundance of information creates the poverty of attention and the necessity to distribute the scarce attention across a large number of possible information sources.", "sample_id": 27}

Social attention can also be associated with collective attention, i.e., the attention paid by many. Digital media and the Internet are facilitating the participation in this economy, by creating new ways of distributing attention. Ordinary people can now publish their own content and comment on other people’s content. In marketing, the attention of a prospective buyer is treated as a resource.

The economy has been present since the human being began to produce, transport, and distribute goods and services. As societies grew more complex, their economies also grew. The Babylonians were the first to develop a legal and administrative system, including courts, prisons, and official records. Subsequently, the Babylonians and their neighboring city-states established the foundations of the economy, which have a close resemblance to modern economics, such as the debt, the contract, and the purchase, as well as the idea of private property.

In the broadest sense, it is a dynamic social phenomenon in which economic activities take place within the framework of human activity. It is the product of the activity of individuals, firms, companies, and governments. Production is the main driving force of an economy, and it involves the management of natural resources, labor, and capital. Economic activity occurs when two parties agree on the price of a good or service, which is usually expressed in a specific currency. However, the share of monetary exchange is just a fraction of the economic environment. Hence, an economy also includes the natural resources, such as forests, grazing lands, and mineral resources, the distribution and use of which also form an important part of it.

{"x": "In the seventeenth century, the most prominent bankers, such as Mayer Amschel, Rothschild, and Vanderborght, began to finance national works, such as the building of roads and the equipment of armies. The economy was henceforth bound up with the interest of the state, and the domain of its action extended to the sphere of the state. The Scotsman Adam Smith is generally considered as the first modern economist; he was influenced by physiocracy, the reaction to mercantilism, and laid down the basic ideas of a national economy. The industrial revolution marked a decisive change in the economy. The supply and demand principle was extended by Thomas Malthus to the problem of overpopulation. He established that a natural price for products was set by competition, competition, the division of labour, and free trade. He argued that human interest was the principal motivating force behind free trade. This contributed to a better understanding of the dynamics of the economy in relation to population growth and the exploitation of natural resources.", "sample_id": 34}
{"x": "In the earliest times the exchange of goods was generally a matter of social relations and barter; the ancient Greeks, from whom the word “economy” derives, were often bond slaves, while in the markets barter was a common form of business. The shekel was a unit of money and weight, as the English pound originally signified a pound of silver. During the Middle Ages the trade was mostly subsistence, the exchanges being usually between social groups. The Chinese, in their code of laws, brought in the idea that a non-market economy could foster institutional innovation, because in this way the firms were not exposed to bureaucratic exploitation. The discussions of that time were strongly influenced by the idea of scarcity. Among the explorers, the early development of a world market was aided by Marco Polo (1254-1324), Columbus (1451-1506), and Vasco da Gama (1469-1524). Some of the greatest conquerors, of course, obtained capital – now known as venture capital, from the Italian ventura, meaning risk – for their expeditions, expecting to recoup their investments with goods from newly discovered lands. The concept of economy was in this period mostly a matter of trade, since European conquests resulted in the establishment of colonies as colonies of European states. The earliest business firms were merchants, and in 1513 the first stock exchange was set up in Antwerp.", "sample_id": 35}
{"x": "The fall of the Wall and the ensuing transition of Eastern European countries towards democracy and market economies, brought back to the fore the concept of the post-industrial society. In many countries the economic system that developed during this period is called social market economy. It combines free market capitalist principles with the introduction of social and labour regulations to ensure fair competition and a level playing field. In the influential book The Affluent Society of 1958, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith had already coined the word in the title: The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society. The introduction of the Internet as a mass medium of communication, in particular after the turn of the millennium, led to the emergence of the e-commerce and the emergence of a new kind of society, characterised by digital interconnectedness, digitisation and the growing importance of information and communication. The growing importance of the service sector, which has increasingly overshadowed the importance of industry, is emphasised in this concept.", "sample_id": 36}
{"x": "The market economy is characterized by the production and exchange of goods and services, based on the law of supply and demand. The actors, the economic agents, carry out the exchange either by barter or by using money as a medium of exchange. The economic system can be divided into several types, based on its nature. In the regulated economy, the government or the political agents direct the production, the distribution and the price of goods and services. The system aims to allocate resources according to a predetermined plan rather than through the laws of the market. In the market economy, the price is determined by the meeting of buyers and sellers. The so-called “e-conomy” is characterized by the provision of short-term, flexible jobs, often mediated through digital platforms. A green economy is characterized by the pursuit of low emissions and resource efficiency. Growth and employment are promoted through public and private investments in the reduction of pollution, the increase of energy efficiency, the conservation of nature and its services. The international economy includes all the interconnected economies of the countries of the world. It shows the interdependence and interaction of the world's countries. In this economy, the jobs are usually tasks, not traditional careers. The development of the economy can be divided into several historical phases. The economy of the shadows is the economy of economic activities not subject to state control and not subject to state taxes. It includes a variety of economic activities, from the sale of flowers on the street to the non-indicated trade. The transition from subsistence farming to the production of products and industrial products began with the Industrial Revolution. The ancient economy was based on agrarianism, on the simple fact that the community produced for its own use. These phases are characterized by the dynamism of the economy, its adaptation to the needs of society and the possibilities of technology. The exploitation of the earth, the building and the manufacture of machines, which played a decisive role in the last three centuries, also increased during this period.", "sample_id": 37}
{"x": "In modern terminology, the expression ‘real economy’ is frequently used by economists and policymakers to designate that portion of the economy which is concerned with the actual production of goods and services. The figures of national income and national income per capita are, in their various ways, the most common measures used for economic analysis; but it should be noted that national income per capita does not take into account the production of those goods and services which are not directly monetary in nature. This distinction is of great importance for the purpose of establishing a true comparative picture of the performance of the economy over time. Measures of the economy can be classified into two main types: nominal, which are figures that are not adjusted for the impact of price changes (real national income, nominal GDP); and nominal, which are figures which are not adjusted for price changes (nominal GDP). ‘Paper economy’ is an expression which designates the financial sector and the financial market activities involved in buying and selling financial instruments. The practical application of economic principles is evident in various spheres, such as commerce, the sciences, government, medicine and civil service, all of which are involved in the production, distribution, exchange and consumption of goods and services. The study of economics is generally divided into two main branches: macroeconomics and microeconomics. These two branches can be viewed as macroeconomics and microeconomics, respectively, and are concerned with, respectively, the subjects of income, production, prices, employment, exchange and other important economic issues. Macroeconomics is normally studied on the regional or national level and includes issues such as national income, national income per capita, employment, international trade and exchange.", "sample_id": 38}
{"x": "AFTER a long period of stagnation, which began in 1972, the United States began in the nineties to revive, a positive and rapid increase in its growth was noticed, in 1995. The word new economy had been introduced by an article published in The New York Times in April 1983. Since the years from 1972 to 1995, the average annual growth of output per hour, which is an indicator of labor productivity, was about ten per cent. However, from 1995 to 1999, this annual growth rate had increased sharply to 2.6%. This resurgence was largely due to a strong improvement in productivity. It has since been a subject of lively discussion among economists and policymakers, for it is a force that will continue to reshape economic activity in the United States and beyond. The economist Robert J. Gordon contributed to the new economy, analyzing its effects and the factors that have influenced it. During this period, the level of employment was rising and the level of inflation falling.", "sample_id": 39}
{"x": "Economist Robert J. Gordon argues that the benefits of computer technology are not widespread, but rather concentrated in the industry of computer hardware and durable goods, which are a relatively small portion of the economy. For the majority of companies, he argues, the impact of these innovations is small or even negative. The innovations of the current “new economy” period, which is to end in the 2040s, are based on the Internet, nanotechnology, telematics and bionics. According to the Kondratiev theory, which asserts that long-term cycles of growth are repeated over and over again, the current “new economy” period should be seen as the last stage of the next Kondratiev wave, which is expected to last another 50 years. It is a period of technological development dominated by the stock exchanges, which grew very rapidly in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and the rise of the NASDAQ as a major competitor to the New York Stock Exchange, the increase in IPOs and the spread of stock options. The term “dot-com” is often used to refer to the period of the “dot-com bubble”, a period when the stock prices of dot-com companies skyrocketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In this period, many dot-com companies were set up and often received a very high evaluation on the stock exchange. Generally speaking, the dot-com period is related to the processes of offshoring, business process offshoring and re-engineering.", "sample_id": 40}
{"x": "MAN, ECONOMY AND STATE (M. M. Rothbard, 1947) is the basic work of Austrian economics, written by the American economist and political philosopher Murray Rothbard. It is a comprehensive analysis of economic principles with special emphasis on the significance of the individual and the role of human choice in economic processes. It is divided into several sections, each of which deals with a different aspect of economic theory. The various economic phenomena, such as the functioning of the market, the role of prices, and the use of capital, are explained. Rothbard begins with a discussion of human action, which he defines as the purposeful striving of the person for a certain end, and he argues that the basis of economics is the concept of human choice. He attacks government intervention in the economy, claiming that it usually leads to distortions and harmful consequences. He also discusses the importance of private property and voluntary exchange for economic cooperation and development. Chapter I. MAN, ECONOMY AND STATE is a classic work of economic literature that provides insights into the workings of the market and human action. It has been considered a seminal work of the Austrian school of economics and has drawn the attention of both its supporters and its opponents. Its arguments have been cited in many contemporary discussions of economic policy and the role of the state in society.", "sample_id": 41}
{"x": "Distinguished economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Blake Belding, have doubted the usefulness of large expenditures on information technology, particularly on developing the properties of fiber-optic cables and developing the functioning of the current software. Moreover, in the last few years some economists have declared that the laws of economics are being superseded by new laws in a rapidly changing sphere of digital information. Advancing the theory of this group of economists, they have been arguing that it is possible to distinguish new and fundamental principles in the domain of a rapidly changing digital world. However, a broader analysis may reveal that the U.S. has been investing heavily in information technology since the beginning of this century. They argue that much of this investment has not been generating the expected returns. On the other hand, subsequent studies have provided compelling evidence that substantial investments in information and communication technology have indeed led to an increase in productivity. In a nutshell, although debates continue about the effects of information technology on economic theory, it is obvious that the relationship between investment in technology and the level of productivity is complex and multiple. The economic downturn of 2001 proved some of the most extreme forecasts made during the boom of the previous years. And this provides some support for the argument of economist Robert G. Gordson that the effect of computers on productivity has been overstated. Hence, further research is necessary to understand the long-term impact of information technology on the economy.", "sample_id": 42}

{"x": "It generalizes the ordinary exchange economy and the usual game. The equilibrium of an abstract economy is the same as the Walrasian equilibrium in microeconomics and the Nash equilibrium in game theory. In theoretical economics, an abstract economy, also called a generalized game, is a model which, while retaining all the elements of microeconomics, includes those of game theory. These theorems were later extended by the workers Shafer and Sonnenschein to the case of irrational subjects, with incomplete and non-additive preferences. This notion was introduced by Gérard Debreu in 1952, when he called it the generalized game, and proved the existence of equilibrium in it; and later, with Kenneth Arrow, he gave the name of an abstract economy to this notion and used the result of existence to prove the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium (also called a competitive equilibrium) in the Arrow–Debreu model. The generalized game consists of a finite number of agents. For each of them, the elements of the set of choices, X_i, are defined: - The choice set X_i (a subset of the unit circle Rn), defining the complete set of possibilities available to the agent; - The set of choice combinations X, X_j is defined such that X = j=1N X_j. The choice correspondence A_i (X  X_i) defines the relationship between the choice set X and the specific choice set of the agent i. This arrangement makes it possible to consider the interaction of the agents in the economy, and to study the equilibrium and the preference relations.", "sample_id": 44}
{"x": "NME is a new, wide and difficult term which describes the colossal role played by the advanced industries in the new world economy. It is based on the fact that these industries are made more efficient by the addition of digital technology, highly skilled workers and other technical resources to the existing material production process. These industries include a strong focus on technology, expansion of operations, IT and e-business. Thomas Friedman cites the economist Lawrence F. Katz, who has pointed out the importance of cooperation between universities, high-tech industries, service and service industries, and flexible newcomers. This may not be a direct mention of the NME, but the basic concept behind it is quite consistent. IT and other new technical developments affect all areas of business and force companies to rely on innovation as a strategic resource. According to the Q4 2010 PwC Industrial Barometer, companies in the industrial sector are more focused on new technology, and new product development is increasingly based on open source development.", "sample_id": 45}
{"x": "In economics, a market participant is characterized by the choice set Xn =. Xn represents the set of all possible price vectors. The utility function of a market participant is defined as Un(y,p)=p  (sum yi – sum wi), where y represents the quantity of goods, p is the price of goods and w represents the amount of good in possession. The market participant seeks to set the price that will equilibrate demand and supply. The price that the market participant chooses depends on certain conditions. When the supply of goods exceeds the demand, the right side of Un(y,p) is negative, and the price falls; on the contrary, when the demand exceeds the supply, it rises, and the price rises. The abstract economy must satisfy these conditions in order to be in equilibrium. Specifically, each consumption set Yn should be closed and convex and the possession wn should be located inside. In addition, each utility function Vi should be continuous and quasi-concave.", "sample_id": 46}
{"x": "But there is no doubt that the economic properties of utility functions have considerably weakened the continuity of the graphs. More precisely, the utility functions are characterized by quasi-concavity in the x-i-axis and upper semi-continuity in the x-axis, and the function U  (x, x )  (max U, x_i, x_-i) is lower semi-continuous. Assuming that the existence of the function U  is guaranteed by the upper semi-continuity of U, it is therefore safe to assume that the function U  exists. Suppose there are N-1 consumers and k homogeneous divisible goods, then for each consumer i, it is defined that: (1) the first k consumers are differentiable, (2) the second k consumers are differentiable, (3) the third k consumers are differentiable, and (4) the k consumers are dividable. , it is therefore valid to conclude that consumers are differentiable, and this framework provides a basic foundation for understanding the behavior of consumers and the allocation of resources in the economy.", "sample_id": 47}
{"x": "“In an exchange economy, the Walrasian equilibrium, or competitive equilibrium, is defined as a sequence of consumption bundles and a price sequence ( i= y_1, y_2,..., y_N-1, p), which satisfies the following conditions: i) (y_i  w_i)  p_y_i  p_w_i. ii) p_y_i  p_w_i p_y_i  p_w_i. This means that if there is an alternative consumption bundle z such that vi_z vi_y_i, then it follows that vi_z vi_y_i p_y_i p_w_i. Thus if there exists an alternative consumption bundle z such that vi_z>vi_y_i, then it follows that vi_z p_w_i p_y_i p_w_i. In consequence, if an alternative consumption bundle z exists, such that vi_z vi_y_i, then it must follow that: p_y_i p_w_i. This implies that, if an alternative consumption bundle z can be defined, then it must follow that: vi_z p_w_i.", "sample_id": 48}
{"x": "This assumption gives the following definition of the choice of agent i: A i (y, p)  y i in Yi with p yi  p w i. The budget of each agent is thus guaranteed not to exceed his budget. In economics it is often supposed that the total amount spent by each agent does not exceed his budget. Then the following result follows: if these three conditions are met, then there is a competition. Also, the utility function U i = Vi shows that the consumption of each agent is optimized to increase the maximum utility of the budget available to him. The generalized model proposed by Shafer and Sun- denschein gives the following characteristics of each agent: - a set of choices X i as defined above. It is important to note that, although the proof begins with the assumption that the utility function Vi depends only on the variable yi, this assumption is not necessary; it remains the same even if the utility function is influenced by consumption choices of other agents (externalities) and by the current price level. As a result, the behavior of the agents in the exchange economy is more complex, taking into account different forms of preferences and constraints. - a set of constraints  i (x, p) determining the possibilities of a budget of the agent; - a set of preferences P i (x, p), showing the preferences of the agent in the context of possible budgets.", "sample_id": 49}
{"x": "In the abstract economy, an equilibrium is defined as a sequence of choices (x=x_1, x_2,..., x_n) such that for each i the choice (x_i) is the one which, subject to the constraint that x_i  A_i(x), represents the greatest satisfaction. The utility of each individual agent, denoted by U_i: X R, is the measure of the satisfaction he finds in each combination of possible choices. For an equilibrium to exist, the following conditions must hold: (1) Each choice set X_i is compact, non-empty and convex; (2) for each agent i there is no other action x_i' A_i(x) such that U_i(x_i, x_-i) > U_i(x_i). This can be expressed mathematically as: (3) each utility function U_i: x R is continuous and quasi-concave with respect to x_i. Each action relation A_i: x R is continuous, non-empty and convex. This formulation provides a model for the economic choice of the agents, the economic decisions of the agents and the final state of equilibrium.", "sample_id": 50}
{"x": "The abstract economy constructed by Debreu represents a special case of a broader type. P_i(x) is the set of z_i which the agent, i, prefers to x_i, under the prevailing choices of other agents, x_i. Generally, an equilibrium of the economy may be defined as the set of choices x = (x_1, x_2, x_, x_n) where, for every agent i, x_i is in A_i(x) and x_i, x_i in P_i(x); the choices of all the other agents are in A_i(x) and no z_i in P_i(x) is contained in A_i(x). The existence of equilibrium requires that each agent chooses within the set of his own action, and within that set his preferences do not apply. The condition that Debreu formulated for a special case of a general equilibrium condition is that P_i(x)  A_i(x) = empty set, which means that each agent chooses within the action set and, within that set, there are no alternatives which are more advantageous than x. 2. The action set, A_i, is a closed set. 3. Each set of choices, x_i, is compact, closed and convex. These conditions constitute the basis for the analysis of the behaviour of the agents in a generalized abstract economy, thereby enabling us to study the relations and equilibria more thoroughly.", "sample_id": 51}

The sum of all prices is 1. In a framework, the basic distribution of the economy, in which the consumers trade goods according to their preferences and the initial endowment of their individual resources, is based.

{"x": "Matthew S. Crawford writes: “Attention is a resource, there is only so much to go around.” Basically, it is an economics of attention that focuses on how we deal with the various informational challenges by applying economic principles. In this context, we encounter a large number of pieces of information, we select some of them, we then decide if we are going to act on this information. The key concept of attention economics is the realization that there are limits to human ability to deal with it. The concept is further developed by Thomas H. Davenport and John C. Beck who define attention as “focused mental engagement with a particular piece of information.” This focused mental engagement enables the individual to filter information from the environment and only take in the relevant information, ignoring the irrelevant. It is widely applied by software engineers who try to apply attention economics principles to the design of user interfaces. They create filters that present the information in accordance with the preferences and interests of the users, based on the latter’s previous activity. In this way, they try to ensure that the most relevant and engaging information is presented to the users, thereby improving their attention and engagement. They realize that if the users cannot find the information they are looking for quickly, they are likely to use alternative applications.", "sample_id": 53}
{"x": "And for every agent i and for each bundle z in the Y-hierarchy, if the agent is strictly for z as compared with his present provision yi (denoted by zsucc yi), then the following condition holds: ‘[p geq p succ yi’]’; which means that if the agent prefers z, he must have the means to pay for it, and if he is not interested in z, he is not obliged to buy it. In short, it ensures that if an agent prefers z, he can pay for it, or that he will have nothing to pay for it, if he is indifferent. In economic theory, a compensated equilibrium is a solution to the equilibrium problem of choice of means of payment and of preference between the individual agents, which sets aside the question of whether they are able to spend their means in the most effective way. For this, we use the principle of Pareto-efficiency. The principle of Pareto-efficiency means that an alternative allocation y' for a subset J of the agents improves their satisfaction in some way for each of them without compromising the satisfaction of any of the other agents, and is expressed by the formula: ‘[sum i in J yi' > sum i in J yi]’. In a word, the Pareto-efficient allocation of the means is a solution that cannot be improved without harming at least one agent.", "sample_id": 54}
{"x": "In the economic analysis of the consumption of information, especially in the mid-nineties, it has been proposed that attention transactions replace monetary transactions as the focus of the economic system. Accordingly, influential writers such as Thomas H. Davenport and Michael Goldhaber have devised concepts like the economy of attention and the economy of attention to describe the phenomenon. Kevin Kelly, a leading digital culture researcher, pointed out in 2008 that the economy of attention increasingly included products with very low reproduction costs. In the field of information systems, the concept has also been embraced, and attentional property has been researched for mechanisms that establish ownership of attention, in order to address the challenges that the economy of attention poses for consumers and producers. But for the suppliers, it is about providing a valuable and irreplaceable intangible asset, thus increasing the overall value of their products.", "sample_id": 55}
{"x": "The reduction shows that certain conditions are sufficient for the existence of a competitive equilibrium in a generalized market: 1. The Arrow–Debreu reduction described here makes the transition from Arrow–Debreu exchange economy to Debreu’s abstract economy, and the same process can be applied to the generalized exchange economy of Mas–Colell, or to the generalized abstract economy of Shafer–Sonnenschein. The Arrow–Debreu exchange economy has two essentially independent aspects. One is that for each bundle x the convex set P_i(x) is convex and excludes x itself, which is irreflexivity. The other is that each preference relation prec_i is relatively open, which is equivalent to saying that each preference ordering P_i has an open graph. The third condition, added by Mas–Colell, is that the set P_i(x) not be empty, which ensures non-saturation. In order to illustrate the failure of the existence of equilibrium when the condition of the open graph is not satisfied, let us take a two-commodity economy, say of apples and bananas, in which two agents have the same initial endowment: two apples and two bananas. This example illustrates the importance of the open graph for the existence of a competitive equilibrium in a market.", "sample_id": 56}
{"x": "With the advent of digital media and the Internet, a new frontier of attention has been opened up, with a wealth of new ways to disperse attention. Long-term attention is the time devoted to the daily commotion of our social relations. An overly extended social relationship can lead to “social interaction overload,” the phenomenon in which people feel overwhelmed by the burden of maintaining their relationships, especially in the context of social media that generate large amounts of social solicitations. In advertising, the theory of “attention economics” regards consumer attention as a valuable resource. The individual’s capacity to reach a wide audience, by producing and sharing content, and to engage with the content produced by others, has also led to the theory of collective attention, which is concerned with the speed with which novelty is spread throughout a population. A standard model of advertising has been the AIDA model, which consists of four stages: Attention, Interest, Desire and Action.", "sample_id": 57}
{"x": "However, let us suppose for the sake of contradiction that equilibrium does exist. This relation, of course, does not have a graph, which shows that the economy does not have equilibrium. In this situation, two cases can be seen: 1. The first supposes that the allocations of both the aforesaid subjects are at least of the form (1, 1) lexicographically. This implies that the allocations of both subjects are precisely (1, 1). 2. The second case supposes that the price of bananas, p, is some non-zero positive number such that the price of apples is normalized to one. Then the allocations of both the subjects are (p, 0), which is strictly preferable to their present allocations. This allocation is also strictly better than their allocation of (1, 1). In either case, the price in question cannot be the equilibrium price. This shows that the distribution is not a monopoly. Those authors have established their conclusions based on several crucial assumptions. —Y i is a nonempty, convex, closed, and lower-bounded set. —There is a positive-closed preference relation: —P i (y i) eq emptyset, which means that there is no saturating.", "sample_id": 58}
{"x": "For this reason, “information overload” can influence a decision, because the prospect of the benefit being greater than the cost of obtaining the information is a motive for continuing to search for and compare products. Attention, therefore, has become a scarce and valuable resource. One way of looking at excessive information is to consider various forms of it, such as advertising and email spam, as a kind of pollution, a negative externality. Critics have complained that these advertisers create advertisements that get people’s attention without asking or paying them for it. The practice has been called “the theft of attention” and the ethical repercussions have been criticized. To deal with externalities, economist Ronald Coase in a 1960 article called “The Problem of Social Cost” pointed to the possibility of putting them in the marketplace. Air and water pollution, for example, are negative externalities that have an impact on society and the environment. Using the same approach to information pollution may help find a way to balance the interests of consumers and the companies that produce it, as well as reduce the adverse effects of over-information. This approach originated in an earlier article by Coase, “Communications and the Problem of the Commons,” in which he suggested that interference in radio communications was a negative externality that could be dealt with by making the interference subject to a property right.", "sample_id": 59}
