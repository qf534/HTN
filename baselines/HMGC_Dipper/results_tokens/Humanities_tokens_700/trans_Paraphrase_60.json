{"x": "In the Western style, the three classic forms of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. Art, a general term for all activities of human intellect and imagination, and for the things they produce, is not precisely defined, and has varied from one age to another, and from one people to another, with infinite variety, and often changing in nature. It included until the seventeenth century all the intellectual and manual activities, and was not distinguished from the sciences and the professions. In the modern view, where aesthetics is the ruling principle, the fine arts are set off from general skills such as the decorative and applied arts. Theater, dance, and the performing arts, such as music, literature, film, and other media such as digital media, are included in a wider definition of the arts. The work of art as such has existed from the earliest days of human history to the present day. Some theorists deny that the concept of art proper is valid for any period or culture except modern Western culture. The study of the nature of art and its relations to other things such as genius, and interpretation, is a field of philosophy called aesthetics. The result of the art, the work of art, is the study of the specialist in the field of art criticism or the history of art.", "sample_id": 0}
{"x": "In the course of time, philosophers—Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and Immanuel Kant, among others—have questioned the meaning of art. Besides these there are many other popular uses of the word, though all have some connection with its etymology. In Plato’s dialogues, Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational, and speaks in favour of this and other divine madnesses (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreams) in the Phaedo, but in the Republic he wants to outlaw Homer’s great poetic art, and also laughter. On the other hand, in the Ion he has nothing but praise for Homer. Aristotle wrote that epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, the dithyrambic verse, and music are all the arts of imitation or mimesis, but that their mimesis is of different modes, objects, and ways. The Ion suggests that Homer’s Iliad, as the Bible does today in the Christian world, was to ancient Greeks the inspired literary art that provided moral guidance, provided only that it was properly interpreted.", "sample_id": 1}
{"x": "And finally, they differ in their mode of imitating, through character or story, through change or without change, and through the dramatic or without the dramatic. The forms also differ in the object they imitate: comedy, for example, is the dramatic imitation of men who are less than the average, whereas tragedy imitates men who are slightly above the average. A more recent and particular sense of the word art, as an abbreviation for fine art or the creative arts, was first introduced in the early seventeenth century. It is a mode of expression of the creativity of the artist, or the aesthetic perception of the spectator, or the lure of the spectator to more refined or finer works of art. Aristotle held that imitation is a natural human action and is one of man’s advantages over animals. The fine arts (art as a study) are a series of sciences that produce works of art (art as objects), which express the personal urge of the artist (art as activity) and communicate a certain meaning, mood, or symbolism to the perceiver (art as experience). Art, therefore, is that which stimulates thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and ideas through the senses. In this sense the word art may mean several things: (i) the study of the creative art; (ii) the process of using the creative art; (ii) the product of the creative art; or (iii) the spectator’s experience of the creative art.", "sample_id": 2}
{"x": "Sometimes, if the skill is applied in a practical or everyday way, it is called a craft instead of an art. In the same way, if the skill is applied to a business or a profession, it is called a commercial art instead of fine art. For some scholars, such as Kant, art and science could be distinguished from each other by science representing the sphere of knowledge, and art representing the sphere of free artistic expression. But in many cases, art has purposes other than purely creative and artistic expression. Some art enthusiasts have argued that the difference between fine art and commercial art is less a matter of clear definition than a matter of judging value. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes said to be fine art. Moreover, Richard Wollheim has said that the nature of art is \"one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture.\" The purpose of the work of art may be to express ideas, such as politically, spiritually, philosophically, to create a beautiful impression (see aesthetics), to explore the nature of perception, to bring pleasure, or to arouse strong emotions. In some cases, however, the purpose is completely undefined. Art is also said to be a way to express or communicate emotions and ideas, a way to study and enjoy form for its own sake, and a way to represent things.", "sample_id": 3}
{"x": "The notion of art as form is a Kantian idea which Roger Fry and Clive Bell developed in the early twentieth century. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood argued that art was the expression of feelings and that the work of art was inherently located in the creator’s mind. Leo Tolstoy viewed art as a means of communication between people, in the sense of making contact from one to another indirectly. As for a more recent theory, in the words of American critic L. Shiner, fine art is not an essence or a fate, but something that we have made. In George Dickie’s institutional theory of art, a work of art is any object on which the art world, or some similar social institution, confers the status of candidate for appreciation. During the Romantic era, art came to be regarded as a special faculty of the human mind to be placed alongside religion and science. It can be characterized by its mimesis (representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other features. In the concept of art as we have come to understand it, the idea of art as we have come to know it is only about two hundred years old. I have seen some shells decorated by homo erectus dated between 540,000 and 430,000 years.", "sample_id": 4}
{"x": "The oldest painting discovered in Europe is the 51,000-year-old Great Fish of the Einhorn Cave in Switzerland, a work of Neanderthal art. A drilled shell, about 75,000 years old, has been found in a South African cave. So far back as 100,000 years there have been found pigment containers. The first sculptures, the first works similar to the Venus of the Rocks, are to be found in the Swabian Jura Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Here are the oldest works of art which are not confined to a single location, carved animal and human figures, and the oldest musical instruments known to science. These are dated between 43,000 and 35,000 B.C. and are the first center of human art. During the upper Paleolithic period, which lasted from about 40,000 years, to the first Neolithic period, there have been found rock paintings and carvings, but the meaning of this art is often unclear, because we know so little about the cultures that created it.", "sample_id": 5}
{"x": "Greek art, for instance, which celebrated the human form, developed the necessary talent to render it with muscle, strength, grace, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. By the vastness and duration of these civilizations, more of their artistic achievements have been preserved, and their influence has been passed on to later times and civilizations. Then, during the later Middle Ages, Byzantine art – which, as we know, had Greek as its starting-point – turned more and more to the realistic presentation of the material world and man’s place in it, which was expressed in a greater attention to the human form and to the development of a logical system of graphic perspective to render the illusion of three dimensions in a two-dimensional picture. Byzantine and medieval art, however, remained much more receptive to realism in its small-scale works, and the realism of small-scale works of art remained in force in the Catholic countries. In the East, too, religious sentiment dominated art. The Islamic rejection of all representation was expressed in its graphic, calligraphic and architectural forms.", "sample_id": 6}
{"x": "And each dynasty has its own style, and art has also become a tradition of the ruling dynasty, so that the paintings of the Tang Dynasty are sober, and the paintings of the Ming Dynasty are not only colorful but also full of composition. There are many artifacts in the history of Chinese art, including jade carvings, bronze figurines, pottery figurines, terracotta figurines, poems, calligraphy, music, paintings, drama, novels, etc. In the West, the eighteenth century was the enlightenment period, and the scientific and rational aspects of the clockwork universe were portrayed by artists, and the social and political revolution was depicted in the painting. For example, Blake portrays Newton as a godlike geometrician; Jacques-Louis David's paintings advocate abolishing monarchy. In Japan, the style of painting and calligraphy also follow the name of the dynasty, and the style of calligraphy and painting is also a \"chosen thing.\" During the last century, there were many artistic movements, such as academic art, symbolism, impressionism, and fauvism. This led to the development of romantic art, which portrayed the individual and emotional features of people as the main line, such as the works of Goethe.", "sample_id": 7}
{"x": "The growing international contact during this time was matched by the increasing influence of other cultures on Western art. The categories of impressionism, expressionism, fauvism, cubism, dadaism, surrealism and the like are therefore unable to be retained beyond the period of their emergence. It is precisely in the 20th century that Western ideas of communism and postmodernism have been applied to the East with increasing success, and vice versa. The impact of Japanese prints, themselves influenced by the drawings of the Renaissance, is reflected in impressionism and its subsequent development, as is that of African sculpture on Matisse and some of Picasso. As a result of the impact of these and other cultures, relativism has become an inalienable truth, and so we are in the postmodern period, in which the world’s and history’s cultures are perceived as fluid forms which are only available for criticism and inspiration if approached ironically and sceptically. The modernist quest for truth gave way to the realization that it could not be achieved. Theodor W. Adorno declared in 1970 that “in art it is now taken for granted that nothing can be taken for granted: neither the concept of art itself, nor the concept of art’s position in the world, nor even the right of art to exist.”", "sample_id": 8}
{"x": "Works of art are not merely representatives of the thing in itself, but the production of a sense of the community. In his fundamental book, The Origin of the Work of Art, Martin Heidegger, the German philosopher, who explains the essence of art in terms of being and truth, argues that art not only expresses the essential component of truth within the community but is also the means of its creation, and that art is a tool that reveals “that which is.” Art and artistic skills and ideas have often been transmitted by trade. An example is the Silk Road, where Hellenistic, Indian, and Chinese art and ideas could mix. Each time a new work of art is added to a culture, the meaning of “being” is inherently changed. The mixing of different cultures has influenced the creation of art; an example of this is the meeting of James Joyce and Central European writers in Trieste at the beginning of the twentieth century, and the artistic development of New York, the melting pot of culture. Greek Buddhist art is the most obvious example of this. The field of art is often divided into several separate categories, the most obvious being media, form, genre, and style. The most important ones are: form, genre, media, and style.", "sample_id": 9}
{"x": "There are three philosophies of art, according to which art is of three sorts, namely, form, content, and setting. The form is the form of the thing, the physical composition, the method of the artist, the physical arrangement, the non-semantic figures, such as colour, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, tone, and value. It may be related to the principles of composition, such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, balance, and rhythm. Generally, philosophers disagree with this idea and hold that there are aesthetics in art beyond the form. Extreme formalism is the theory that all aesthetic properties are attributed to form. Extreme idealism is the theory that the content is the most important thing in art, and that the content is only the intention of the artist and the content of the artist's intention. The subject is the people and things depicted, and the content is the artist's intention. Some scholars talk about the subject and the content (that is, denotation and connotation), and some scholars talk about the significance and meaning. Is that the same as the composition of Napoleon on the throne?", "sample_id": 10}
{"x": "Its restrictive interpretation is'socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal and politically imprudent'. Philosophers are similarly opposed to the extreme of intentionalism, because works of art can have multiple ambiguous meanings, the intention of the author can be unknowable and therefore irrelevant. “God outside time and space.” In some cases, historical and material conditions may prevail, such as theological, philosophical, sociopolitical, economic and even climatic conditions. Finally, post-structuralism is now examining the art object in the context of culture, that is, the emotions, thoughts and reactions evoked by a work of art. Art can denote skilful work, the skill of using a medium, or the skill of making language evoke more immediate or profound meaning. Art criticism is developing and growing together with art. There is a kind of understanding of the material that arises from the handling of it, which allows thinking. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts and observations.", "sample_id": 11}
{"x": "In the time of the turn of the century the dexterous works of John Sargent were admired and doubted as to their virtuosity, while at almost the same time the man who was to become the resolute and wandering iconoclast, Pablo Picasso, was completing his classical art-school training. In earlier times, in fact, the skills of the executioner have been seen as essential to art and indispensable for its success. Rembrandt’s work, now praised for its ephemeral qualities, was considered by his contemporaries to be above all a virtuoso production. In the conceptual sphere Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain was one of the first works in which the artist makes use of found objects and does not use any of the traditional skills. Today the examples of this type are Tracey Emin’s My Bed or Damien Hirst’s The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living and, like them, those that exploit the media. A modern criticism of some art is that it is unnatural that so little skill should have been involved in its production.", "sample_id": 12}
{"x": "For all the fame that has accrued to Hirst, his fame is based exclusively on his talent for producing outlandish ideas. In the case of many of his works, the production consists of assembling ready-made components. The execution of many of his works is outsourced to a team of craftsmen. The function of art, in its widest sense, has been ambiguous in the extreme. This is not because art has no purpose, but because it has so many distinct functions. Yet, there are still many artists of the modern era, if not in the vanguard of those who practise painting and sculpture, but in the pursuit of skills that are still in vogue. There are two broad classes of purpose of art: the non-utilitarian, and the utilitarian. Non-utilitarian functions are those that are inherent to human beings, involving no private gain, and that are beyond the sphere of an individual’s activities. Some of these purposes are outlined below. Harmony, equilibrium and rhythm are basic human instincts. Art, as a creative act, is something that human beings have to do by their very nature, and because of this, art can be considered non-utilitarian.", "sample_id": 13}
{"x": "By the fact that individuals have, starting with this natural gift, gradually developed their special skills, they have given birth to poetry. Imitation is one of the instincts of nature. Harmony and rhythm are also instincts, and meters are, in fact, rhythmic structures. Poetry offers a way to experience oneself in relation to the universe. This experience may come about without warning when one experiences art, music, or poetry. —Aristotle The experience of the mysterious. Expression of the imagination. The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious; it is the source of all true art and science. —Albert Einstein Jupiter’s eagle is not, as is the case with logically (aesthetically) represented objects, a concept of the sublime and majestic power of creation, but something else, something that sets the imagination free to fly among a whole range of similar images that give rise to far more ideas than the concept of a fixed word can express. Art offers the opportunity to express the imagination without being bound by grammatical rules. For whereas words follow one another in sequence and each of them has a definite meaning, art offers forms, images, and ideas whose meaning is quite pliable.", "sample_id": 14}
{"x": "‘Ritualistic and Symbolic functions: Art is used in many cultures for the decoration and symbolism of rituals, ceremonies and dances, and though it is sometimes quite unnecessary for the practical (economic) needs of a particular culture, anthropologists know that it does serve a purpose in a symbolic sense in the specific cultural context. Immanuel Kant:1’ ‘Motivated functions: Artistic functions are aimed at consciously motivated actions on the part of the artist or creator. The meaning of the work is not provided by a single person but by the process of change within a culture spanning several generations.’ Silva Tomaskova, Introduction to the Paleolithic Age in the Czech Lands and in Slovakia. ‘Communication. Art in its most basic sense is a form of communication. It may aim at bringing about political change, at commenting on social phenomena, at expressing particular emotions, at introspective psychology, at illustrating other sciences, or, in the case of commercial art, at selling products.’ ‘Communication is motivated by the fact that it usually has an aim directed towards another person.’", "sample_id": 15}
{"x": "To wit, it is not necessary for the content to be scientific; emotions, moods, feelings can be transmitted through art. Maps are an example of this. Art is a means of transmitting emotions and moods, to entertain and relieve the mind of the viewer. Art is artifacts or images with symbolic meanings, as a means of communication. Art as a tool for political change. This is a function often served by art industries like film and video games. But the realist attitude, sprang from the Positivists, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, seems to me completely opposed to any moral or intellectual progress. Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, Abstract Expressionism, are a few of the art movements which have this objective. It is this attitude which gives birth to the wretched books and insulting plays of the day. It is constantly drawn upon and nourished by the newspapers and keeps stifling art and science by pandering to the lowest forms of vulgarity, a stupid clarity, living like a dog. I loathe it, for it is mediocrity, rage and boring arrogance. Art as a “free space” unaffected by social censure. André Breton (Surrealism).", "sample_id": 16}
{"x": "Art of investigation, subversion, or anarchy. Similar to art for political reform, the subversive or deconstructive form can question a section of society without any political goal. Also, as with graffiti, some art can become illegal, as when it breaks the law (vandalism, in this case). Art for social causes. The fashion trend of wearing “trash,” as with artists like Marina de Bris, is one example of the art of drawing attention to pollution. There are various activities of artists devoted to bringing to the attention of the public a host of social problems: of autism, of cancer, of human trafficking, of the conservation of the seas, of human rights in Darfur, of the murdered and disappeared Aborigines, of the abuses of the old. Art for psychological or therapeutic purposes.", "sample_id": 17}
{"x": "The creation of a work is not the goal, but rather the healing process that it can produce. For example, the Diagnostic Drawing Series is used to test the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. Similar to the Diagnostic Drawings, art that is used to sell products can also influence the emotions. Art for propaganda or commerce. Those who have argued this point have argued that the human brain far exceeds the abilities that were required for survival in the ancestral environment. In both cases, the purpose of the work is to evoke a specific emotion or psychological reaction in the viewer towards a specific idea or object. Art as a fitness indicator. For example, the tail of the male peacock has been considered a fitness indicator (Fisherian Runaway). The same is true of the human brain and the resulting characteristics such as artistic creativity and talent.", "sample_id": 18}
{"x": "For example, art that is primarily intended for entertainment can also be used to sell a product, such as a movie or a computer game. All these functions are not mutually exclusive, but may overlap with each other. Art can be divided into as many steps as one can reason about, but this part is dividing the process into three broad steps. In the first step, the artist imagines his or her work in his or her mind. Inspiration is the main drive of art, and is mainly based on instinct, impressions and feelings. The artist imagines what his or her work will be, and in this way the artist begins to make it. Getting ready for the art may include investigating and approaching the subject. If the artist's mood, surroundings or state of mind influences the creation of art, this can be observed. For example, the Goya black paintings, which Goya made in the latter part of his life, are believed to have been made so dark because of the isolation he suffered and his experience of the war. In the second step, the artist works on his or her art. Trial and error are regarded as a part of the creation process. Some of the greatest hits of the English group the Beatles, such as \"Revolver\", are credited to the use of LSD and cannabis.

{"x": "According to professional journals, the reflection on art is considered a part of the art experience. In a recent study, more than half of visual art students said that reflection is an important part of the art process. In the artistic experience, the beauty of the work of art evokes a wide range of emotions. While many focus on whether art is judged as good or successful by those who view, listen to, or experience it, art has other values beyond its commercial value as a means of public information and cultural health. Since ancient times, the finest art has often been a deliberate demonstration of wealth or power, often with large scale and expensive materials. The less costly art was commissioned by the political and religious authorities, and only the very wealthy could afford it. Some art is meant to be practical, for example, through scholarly analysis, and to encourage debate. However, in many eras, art has been available to large parts of society. In addition to low-cost pottery that is durable underground, it has also been found in disposable media such as textiles and wood.", "sample_id": 20}
{"x": "The stamp seals were a most artistic and useful thing, used very generally by the people of the middle class in the Near East. Once coins became common, they too became an art form extending over a large section of society. Reproduction by moulds, as in the case of Roman pottery and Greek figurines, enabled high-grade pottery and figurines to be made easily and distributed over a wide area. Prints of all kinds have been used for a long time to decorate houses and public places. Books were originally very expensive but later fell in price and by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with illustrations. Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe when the printing of wood-cuts began, mostly religious ones and often very small, so that they were affordable even to peasants, who pasted them on the walls of their homes. By now, the Kunstmuseum in Basel, founded in 1661, has a collection of art ranging from the 15th century to the present day. It is one of the most prestigious art museums in the world. They have some excellent collections, among them paintings and drawings from the Upper Rhineland between the 14th and 16th centuries, and also an important collection of the art of the 19th and 20th centuries.", "sample_id": 21}

The Egyptian temples are a good example in that their most extensive and extravagant decorations are to be found in the parts that are visible to the public, rather than in the sacred quarters where they are only seen by the priests. From the time of the Renaissance, a grand tour of the masterpieces of Italy was a very important industry. The Italian states and towns did everything they could to facilitate this.", "sample_id": 22}
{"x": "... The reorganization of the Louvre in 1793, the transfer of the ownership of the old royal collections to the republican state, no doubt marked an important moment in the development of the public sphere and of art, but it was also a continuation of an already well-established trend. The foundation of the Prado in Madrid in 1789, the house where the Prado is today, was the result of an already established desire to make part of the king's art collection accessible to the public, and there were similar royal galleries open to the public in Vienna, Munich and other cities. In the United States, museums are often the gifts of the very rich to the public. However, the museum is not only a crude stage for art, but plays an active and vital role in the general perception of art in modern society. So the museum is not only a simple stage for art, but plays an active and vital role in the overall perception of art in modern society.

{"x": "\"You have to present more than just things,\" the important post-war German artist Joseph Beuys said. Artists have tried to create art that cannot be purchased by the wealthy as a status symbol. Democratic ideas based on the notion that a work of art is a commodity were the spur for the artistic innovation of the second half of the 1960s and the seventies. Performance art, video art, and concept art were born in this period. The concept was that if the art was something that could not be kept or if it was an idea, it could not be bought. In the following decades, these ideas have become obscured, since the art market has been able to sell limited editions of videos, tickets to the most select performances, and the remaining objects of a conceptual art piece. Artists associated with the general term concept art have generally avoided the materiality of the painting or the sculptures, and they have used performances and publications to attack the object as such.", "sample_id": 24}
{"x": "We have an abundant number of art controversies from the past, of which there is scarcely any evidence, or else they have been lost. In the last century a common use of the recorded DVD and VHS media has given a distinct edge to art institutions, and the public purchases the art in a limited number of copies. The art is now the means by which one can show that one understands, rather than the way of owning it. The artistic activity, however, remains upper-class, and one must, one may, prove, to be able to enjoy it. Aniquism is the dislike of figurative images, or often only religious ones, and has been part of many major religions, for example, it was a crucial element in the history of Islamic art, where the representation of Muhammad is especially controversial. Iconoclasm is the destruction of works of art for various reasons, including religious. It has often been the case that artistic conventions have been conservative and have been taken very seriously by art critics, but often less so by a wider public. The artistic content has been controversial, for example, the late medieval depictions of the new motif of \"the kiss of the Virgin\" in images of the crucifixion of Jesus. Many art works have been disliked because they depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular leaders, parties or other groups.", "sample_id": 25}

But, as in the past, the content of many formal works of art has depended more on the commissioning party than on the artist, so that the advent of Romanticism, together with changes in the production methods of the artist, has largely increased the number of the controversies and often reduced their importance. The gradual abandonment of realism and the realistic representation of the appearance of the characters in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has led to a continuous controversy for over a century. Édouard Manet's Luncheon on the Herbs (1863) was considered scandalous, not because the nudity of the woman, but because the men with her in the painting were dressed in the clothes of the time, not in the ancient clothes. John Singer Sargent's Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madame X) (1884) caused a controversy because the earlobe was painted in a reddish pink color, considered too suggestive and ruined the reputation of the high-society woman.", "sample_id": 26}

The English critic John Ruskin, who favored Turner's naturalism, believed that art's role was to create a fundamental truth, which nature alone can teach. Before modernism, art criticism in the West had always been very concerned with balancing the ideal and the realistic in art. This concern has always changed with the times. But it has been especially problematic in the twentieth century. Since the beginning of the century, the question of what art is and how to evaluate it has become particularly difficult.", "sample_id": 27}
{"x": "The coming of Modernism to a large extent radically changed the view of the function of art, and the coming of Postmodernism did the same in the twentieth century. Clement Greenberg, in his article “Modernist Painting” from 1960, defines modern art as “the use of methods characteristic of the given field in order to criticize the field itself”; the term was first used by him in the context of a discussion of the abstract expressionists, who had ceased to paint illusionistic pictures, and instead had painted flat, nonillusionistic paintings. As a result of Greenberg’s theory, many important theorists have come forward, including Michael Fried, T. J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin, and Griselda Pollock, among others. The limitations inherent in the materiality of the painting, the flat surface, the shape of the support, the material of the pigments—the limitations of these were viewed by the Old Masters as negative, as factors that had to be acknowledged only indirectly or implicitly, while in the case of Modernism they became positive, openly acknowledged.", "sample_id": 28}
{"x": "Duchamp had once declared that art is any kind of activity, all kinds of activities. In the eighties, nineties, and noughties, art has enlarged this technique of self-criticism outside the field of high art to include all the images that compose the society, such as fashion, comics, posters, or pornography. Andy Warhol, for example, became famous for his inscription in the art world and for his critical reflections on popular art. There is some evidence that this may be true. In his book The Invention of Art, a cultural history, Shiner studies the formation of the modern system of art, that is to say, the art that today is only a number of activities, and a very social one. He finds evidence that the primitive system of art, before our present system (fine art), regarded art as any humanly accomplished activity. Ancient Greek society, for example, had no word for art, but techne. Techne is not art nor work, because art and work are historical distinctions which were made later. The Greeks included in the concept of techne not only painting, sculpting, music, but also cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, agriculture, etc.", "sample_id": 29}
{"x": "In the Western way of thinking, the three classic departments of the fine arts are painting, sculpture and architecture. The definition of art remains the subject of a great dispute, and is of great importance to a wide variety of different cultures. Historical usage until the seventeenth century, with its emphasis on mastery, meant that art was not regarded as different from the sciences and the trades. In the modern way of thinking, art is distinguished from the other fields of acquired skill, and it is especially distinguished from the decorative or applied arts. In a wider sense, the fine arts are also theatre, dance, music, literature, cinema, and computer games. The works of art have been almost as long in existence as mankind itself, from prehistoric art to contemporary art. The philosophical field of aesthetics studies the nature of art, and the related concepts of creativity and interpretation, and the works of art are further investigated by art critics and art historians. The idea that there are works of art in the Western way of thinking may not be applicable outside of modern Western society.", "sample_id": 30}
{"x": "The art of China has evolved at different times, with different styles. The styles are divided into dynasties, and in the different dynasties there are different styles. For example, Tang Dynasty art, monochrome, simple, scenery, characterized by a very broad brush, and the point of view. The poetry and calligraphy of ancient China are very rich, and they are divided into eight classes, namely, poems, calligraphy, painting, music, drama, and so on. It can be said that Japanese art is also called the emperor's dynasty, but in Japan, there is a special relationship between calligraphy and painting. In the Ming Dynasty, the colors were bright and the layout was very strict, and the scenery was very realistic. In the West, in the 18th century, the enlightenment, art was also popularized, and it was mainly physical and rational. For example, the color painting of the saint and Isaac Newton by William Blake, and the picture of Jacques-Louis David, all of which have political overtones, have also been influenced. In Japan, the woodblock printing plate has been in use since the seventeenth century, and the dissemination of art has been greatly improved. In the last century, Academicism, Symbolism, Impression and Fauvism, etc., have all appeared. Romanticism, a reaction to the enlightenment, is also a result of the movement of thoughts, characterized by emotional expression and individuality, such as the work of Goethe.", "sample_id": 31}
{"x": "Art as Form originates with Kant and was developed in the early twentieth century by theorists such as Roger Fry and Clive Bell. Leo Tolstoy defined art as an indirect means of communication. The Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce and the English philosopher R. G. Collingwood have developed the view that art expresses emotions and that the spirit of the work of art is found in the mind of the artist. Among theorists of recent times, inspired by Martin Heidegger, art has been interpreted as a medium of self-expression and interpretation of the community. George Dickie has developed the theory of the institution of art, in which the work of art is defined as the designation of artifacts by qualified individuals acting on behalf of the social institution known as \"the art world\". The history of art begins in prehistoric times, and one of the earliest artistic creations, the shell with engraved lines by homo erectus, is dated between 430,000 and 540,000 years old. During the Romantic period, art began to be seen as a unique human activity, comparable to religion and science. Art can be characterized by various properties, such as mimesis (the representation of reality), narration, expression and communication of emotions.", "sample_id": 32}
{"x": "Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and Immanuel Kant all deal with the concept of art in their philosophical treatises. Moreover, the word art, as used in English, gives rise to a large number of compounds, including artificial, artificial, artifice, medical art, martial art, etc., all of which are closely related to the original meaning. In Plato's Phaedo, for example, Socrates said that poetry is inspired by the muses, not created by the mind, and it is also a divine madness, and it is a good thing. The same thing is drunk, eroticism and dreams. In the dialogue of Ion, Socrates does not express his antipathy to Homer as in the dialogue of the Republic, and Ion in fact shows the great role of the Iliad in the ancient Greek culture, just as the Bible plays in today's Christian culture. Is. But in the \"Republic\", he will argue that Homer's poetry should be prohibited and ridiculed, which is very complex. In Aristotle's Poetics, he put poetry, tragedy, comedy, mimesis, and music in the same category, each with its own artistic methods and content. Aristotle is famous for his theory of mimesis, and he used the five senses to distinguish each kind of art.", "sample_id": 33}
{"x": "The earliest example of art in Europe is the \"Rhinocerous-bones\" from the cave of the einhorn, which dates from about 50,000 BC and is attributed to the Neanderthals. In the South African caves were discovered some drilled shells, 75,000 years old, and, moreover, pots of old age that seem to have served as paintpots. The first sculptures and other forms of art, such as the famous Venus of the Great Fels, were discovered in the UNESCO World Heritage Caves and ice-age art in the Swabian Jura, but are, as has been said, the subject of much dispute, since we know so little of the cultures that created them. From the countless works of art from ancient civilizations like Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, China, Greece, Rome, Inca, Maya, Olmec, the significance of the work of art in the region of the Swabian Jura can be deduced. It was a form of life and leisure to which art seemed to belong, especially in Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, the ancient Greeks, the Olmecs, the Incas, and the Mayas.", "sample_id": 34}
{"x": "Greek art was characterized by a particular concern for the human figure, the musculature, the balance, the beauty, the anatomy. The long duration and great influence of ancient civilizations has led to the survival of a large number of works of art and the transmission of their artistic practices to succeeding civilizations. It is also from these civilizations that the earliest records of the methods used by the artists have been derived. By contrast, the art of the Byzantines and the art of the Middle Ages, on the contrary, largely concerned itself with biblical and religious themes, artists used styles which had for their object the effect of conveying to the viewer the presence of the divine, and in particular they made use of the use of gold and glass for the purpose of transmitting to the viewer a sense of the divine. The preparation of this art formed the basis for the arts of the future. The style of the Byzantines retained a certain classic realism, which became more and more noticeable in Catholic Europe. The Renaissance was characterized by a marked shift in style towards a realistic depiction of the material world and of man's place in it. It usually represented figures with flat, idealized forms. The Islamic art, which had rejected the use of iconography, was characterized by its geometric forms, calligraphy, and architecture, whereas further east the emphasis was still on religious themes. The artists were concerned with the physical appearance of the human body and developed systems of graphic perspective which permitted the representation of three-dimensional depth.", "sample_id": 35}
{"x": "For instance, comedy is defined as the dramatic imitation of persons considered inferior to the common run, while tragedy represents persons thought to be above the common run. These forms differ also in the manner of imitation, and the dramatic elements which they have in common are the rudiments of storytelling and the characterization of characters, as well as the variety of means and methods of effect. Art, in the sense of fine art, began to assume its present meaning about the beginning of the seventeenth century. Aristotle laid down that imitation was an innate characteristic of the human race, and a privilege denied to other animals. From this point of view, art includes several different ideas, as a science, as a practice, and as a means of expression. In the broader sense, art embraces a number of branches of knowledge which have for their object the production of art, which are based upon personal expression, which aim at conveying a message, an atmosphere, a symbolic meaning, to be interpreted by the audience. These three categories are art as a science, art as a practice, and art as an experience. The last of these may be regarded as the irradiation of the senses by means of which the mind of the spectator is stimulated to reflect, to believe, to think.", "sample_id": 36}
{"x": "Heidegger’s point is that art is a basic foundation from which “what is” can be found. In his book, “The Origin of the Work of Art,” the German philosopher Martin Heidegger explores the relationship between art and being. Art is disseminated through commerce and trade. Each new art form introduced into a culture changes the collective meaning of being. The meeting of diverse cultures and worldviews has had a significant influence on art. Greek and Buddhist art, for example, has been a crucial vehicle for transforming the world’s art. The visual and performing arts are generally categorized by form, genre, medium, and style, often based on perceptual criteria. Trieste, a diverse port city on the Italian Adriatic, in the early twentieth century was a meeting point for writers from Central Europe, including James Joyce. Similarly, New York City has been called the world’s cultural melting pot. This classification system can help to clarify the relationship between artistic expressions and “what is.”", "sample_id": 37}
{"x": "The growing inter-penetration of the peoples had facilitated the circulation of the art of various cultures, which imposed their influence on the Western art. In the eighteenth century the impressionists, fauvists, cubists, dadaists, surrealists, niktites, and cubists in particular, were still confined to certain lines of work, but in the twentieth century they developed their own range of subjects and were able to deal with them freely. The African sculpture also inspired Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse and influenced modern art. Western art also had a considerable influence on the oriental art in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The most remarkable influence was the Japanese prints, though based on the Renaissance, which influenced impressionism and its successors. In the last half of the twentieth century, when modern art, idealizing the search for truth, became more and more apparent, it was clearly questioned. In 1970 Theodor Adorno summed up this development in these words: \"Now, one does not want to take for granted any more that art exists, or its position in the world, or even the right of art to exist. \" Various ideas, such as the concepts of communism and post-modernism, had a great influence on oriental art. In post-modern art, the cult and history are seen as development and movement, and are regarded with irony and skepticism. It was the emergence of post-modernism that became the style of art and criticism.", "sample_id": 38}
{"x": "In the domain of aesthetics, the notion of the absolute priority of the artist's intention is much criticized. It is generally held to be limiting, because the artistic intention is sometimes unknowable or meaningless. The concept of a God outside of time and space has a place in this realm of ideas. The developing theory of post-structuralism seeks the meaning of art within the context of culture, it concentrates on the thoughts, emotions, reactions that a work evokes, and this type of interpretation is sometimes in common with formalism and intentionalism. Critics, however, complain that this narrow interpretation is socially unhealthy, philosophically unrealistic and politically unwise. Art criticism evolves in parallel with artistic practice. Religious and philosophical concepts, the social, political and economic situation, climate and geography may strongly influence the interpretation of art. On the other hand, material and historical conditions may be given priority. Art is essentially an expression of feelings, thoughts, observations. It may mean a certain ability, a special use of a medium, or the effective use of language in the expression of immediate or deep meaning. One thing is certain: it is usually a result of a deep knowledge of the material that is enriched by practical experience and thus stimulates the thought processes.", "sample_id": 39}
{"x": "The view of art is generally divided into three main theories: Formalism, Interpretation, and Historical Perspective. The analysis of art is basically a consideration of the technique employed by the artist and the physical constitution of his work, giving primary consideration to such non-semantic elements as color, form, dimension, space, melody, and value. The notion of formalism also includes the principles of arrangement and design, such as asymmetry, contrast, tension, harmony, equality, proximity, and rhythm. In a word, the analysis of art is a multi-faceted approach which, by considering form, content, and context, leads to a deeper understanding of artistic expression and its significance. Scholars are not in agreement on the terminology used to describe the significance of art. Some refer to it as the subject, the subject matter, the symbolic meaning, the figurative meaning, and so on, while others use the word significance.", "sample_id": 40}
{"x": "While we nowadays revere Rembrandt for his ephemeral qualities, his contemporaries admired him for his technical skills. For artists like Leonardo da Vinci, art was the direct expression of his virtuosity, and in no way a separate activity. Modern art is often criticised for the supposed lack of skill or virtuosity it takes to produce it. And yet Pablo Picasso, who would later become one of the most influential modern artists, was outstanding in the academies of his day. At the beginning of the twentieth century, John Singer Sargent’s deft handling of paint arouses admiration and scepticism. Modern art grew to embrace mass media and even irony, while rejecting the idea of artistic virtuosity. Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain, one of the first examples of conceptual art, using ready-mades and found objects and bypassing conventional artistic techniques, is a well-known example.", "sample_id": 41}
{"x": "The first metre of the poetry, in the first metre of the verse, is the metre of the first and last stanzas of the three last verses of the three stanzas, namely, \"Of course,\" \"Of course,\" \"Of course,\" \"Of course,\" etc., etc. It is an instinct of human nature to imitate, and, according to Aristotle, it is an instinct of harmony and rhythm. Albert Einstein declared that the most profound experience is the discovery of the unknown, which he considers the basis of all true art and science. Then the connection between man and the universe is examined through art, through music, through poetry, through painting, through all the arts. It is not the words that express the meaning, it is the mighty and exalted majesty of a person that inspires the imagination, the expression of this fact, the words are too limited. Art is a medium of expression that surpasses language, as it is not words, which are sequenced and carry certain meanings, but forms, symbols and ideas, which are capable of being interpreted in different ways.", "sample_id": 42}
{"x": "Contemporary art, moreover, often consists of the arrangement of found objects, a process that is emblematic of the phenomenon of conceptual art. Damien Hirst, who is known for his use of ideas, entrusts the execution of many of his works to highly skilled artisans, and owes his position in the art world to his gift for devising provocative concepts. Though the purposes of art have changed considerably over the course of history, the possibility of a unified concept is still a question. The difference does not indicate that art is devoid of a singular purpose, but that the creation of art is multifaceted. Despite this trend, a number of modern and contemporary artists continue to exercise the basic artistic skills, such as drawing and painting, and continue to create works that require a high degree of handicraft. Art is seen as a fundamental feature of the human species, since no other animal engages in the creative process. The main purposes of art are divided into two categories, according to anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss: those that are externally motivated, and those that are not. The former category, according to Levi-Strauss, consists of the art that is done for its own sake, not to fulfill some purpose. However, Levi-Strauss also acknowledged that art is intrinsically motivated, since art is a manifestation of the human instinct for harmony, balance, and rhythm.", "sample_id": 43}
{"x": "Various art forms are commonly used in performances, in the dress of the dancers, in the rituals of the world. In some of these the purpose of the art is ornamental, in others symbolic, and in some of these they have no distinct use; they merely represent to the natives of these lands, in different ways, the established meaning of the art in the culture which has developed. The purpose of art refers to the conscious and conscious actions of the artists or creators. Scholars who study the cave paintings and other prehistoric materials that lack a practical utility, have classified these works as either decorative, symbolic, or ritual. They also admit the complexities of the concept of art, which leads to many problems in interpretation. Art, in essence, is a means of communication; like other means of communication, it has an aim, an objective, a purpose, and like all means of communication, it has an intention, a purpose. These purposes include advocating political change, criticizing social problems, expressing the emotions, expressing personal experiences, illustrating certain scientific concepts, promoting commercial products, or simply communicating with people.", "sample_id": 44}
{"x": "“The Diagnostic Drawing Series is a therapeutic tool for assessing the personality and emotional functioning of individuals. Unlike conventional psychological tests, its primary objective is not the finished product of the process of drawing, but the healing effects of creative expression. Art has long been employed as a means of propaganda, used to subtly influence the public’s emotions and opinions, while in advertising the objective is to stimulate the emotions of the viewer towards certain products. In the context of ethology, artistic creativity is said to serve a similar function as the tails of peacocks, as a display of a male’s virility to his potential mates. A theory of the runaway selection process and the handicap principle suggests that these traits may have evolved to enhance the chances of reproduction. The vast potential of the human brain is said to be in excess of its original survival requirements.", "sample_id": 45}
{"x": "Art is not only a medium for self-expression, but it also has a value that can be appreciated by others. According to research, a high proportion of art students consider reflection to be a crucial element in the artistic process. Art education journals emphasize that reflection is an essential element of the art-making process. As we all know, the purpose of art is to be enjoyed and to be able to appreciate its beauty. Art is also an important part of society, playing an important role in transmitting knowledge and promoting well-being. As such, there are always discussions of the commercial value of art. Art has always been associated with the show of wealth and power, usually with large-scale and costly materials, many of which are owned by political leaders or religious institutions, while a more easily accessible version is usually used by wealthy individuals. Some art was designed for practical purposes, to encourage analysis and discussion, and to arouse interest and stimulate discussion among the public. In short, art is multifaceted, including personal reflection, societal participation and historical context, and is thus an enduring cultural value. However, there have been times when high-quality art has been available to the public, for example, through cheap pottery that can last a long time, or through inexpensive cloth and wood, which are less durable.", "sample_id": 46}
{"x": "The founding of the Louvre, in 1793, during the French Revolution, marked a turning point in the history of public access to art, as it transferred the former collection of the kings to the state. The building of the Prado in Madrid was built in 1787 to house the art collection of the Spanish Crown. The museum is a means of enabling access to art but also of shaping its perception. The establishment of public museums and art education for children in schools can be seen as part of a wider movement. In the United States, many museums are founded by private individuals, for example, the affluent railway contractor John Taylor Johnston, whose personal art collection provided the basis for the museum. Studies show that the museums play a significant role in influencing how people understand and value art in modern society.", "sample_id": 47}
{"x": "Unlike political art, subversive art or deconstructive art deals with the society itself and invites reflection on it. Unlike political art, it reflects on the society itself, asks the audience to reflect on its values and beliefs. It is a very important tool for raising awareness of various social problems. Various artistic campaigns have been launched against causes such as autism, cancer, human trafficking, protection of the seas, Darfur, murder and disappearance of native Canadian women, and exploitation of old people. Graffiti is a powerful means of social comment, but it is also illegal when it violates the law against vandalism. Art is also seen as a source of therapy and healing. A prominent example is the so-called Trashion movement, which turns discarded material into clothes, a movement represented by artists such as Marina de Brist. This not only encourages creativity, but also draws attention to the issue of the environment and the impact of pollution. People engage in this kind of artistic activity in order to express themselves, confront the issues they are dealing with, and thus to heal. Different artistic forms are used in the therapeutic field in order to support mental health, emotional expression, and personal growth.", "sample_id": 48}
{"x": "The creative process can be divided into several phases, though there is no agreement as to how many. The functions of art are not mutually exclusive, and many overlap. For example, an art created for entertainment may also serve commercial ends, for example, by advertising a film or a game. At the initial phase, the artist visualizes his work and begins to bring it into existence. In the following section, we will consider the three phases: preparation, creation, and reflection. The second phase involves the creation of the work itself. In this phase, the artist also learns about his subject and gathers his inspiration. Often, artistic inspiration comes from instinct, impressions, emotions. In his last years, Francisco Goya created his “Black Paintings,” a series of dark works inspired by his wartime experiences and his solitude. Goya painted them directly on the walls of his house in Spain, and, it is said, he did not speak of them to anyone. In general, the mood of the artist, his environment, and his mental state, often influence the creation process. Though it is not explicitly mentioned in the original, the third phase, reflection, is of equal importance to the process of creating art. Trial and error are often an important part of the creative process, allowing the artist to explore and refine his ideas. The members of the Beatles, for example, have testified that the use of LSD and hashish influenced some of the songs on their Revolver album. In sum, the creative process is a complex one, comprising preparation, creation, and reflection, all of which contribute to the overall experience of the work. After the completion of the work, the artist usually considers the impression it has made, and its effect on the public, and this reflection can further stimulate the creative process and even influence future works.", "sample_id": 49}
{"x": "Besides temples, many of the king's palaces, and other stately residences, were open to the public in certain parts. The ostentation and magnificence of the Egyptian temples were largely confined to the parts most accessible to the public, in contrast to the less exposed and more austere regions reserved for the use of the priesthood. We likewise noticed special arrangements made for public inspection of royal and private collections. These arrangements were sometimes conditioned by dress regulations, as at Versailles, where visitors could hire silver buckles and swords to comply with the required costume. With the establishment of the grand tour, Italy became a great centre of artistic tourism; and governments and local authorities aided the promotion of art by allowing public access to their treasures. In Paris, for example, the Orleans collection, largely situated in the Palais Royal, was for a long time open to the public.", "sample_id": 50}
{"x": "According to Steve Mithen, art is a collection of objects or images, imbued with symbolic meanings, which serve as a means of communication. Art is a means of communication, not only for scientific concepts, but also for emotions, feelings and moods. Also, one of the characteristics of early 20th century art was its role in social reform; various art movements, such as Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, Abstract Expressionism, together known as the avant-garde, challenged social conventions and stimulated thought through visual images. This is especially true of art industries, such as motion pictures and video games, which aim at entertaining and enthralling the audience. The Surrealist André Breton, a prominent figure, has condemned the idea of realism as a source of mediocrity, as being detrimental to both science and art. This approach has been criticized for its alleged hostility to any form of intellectual or moral advancement. It has been said that art should be a “zone of freedom”, a space where ideas can be explored freely without being stifled by censorship.", "sample_id": 51}
{"x": "Coins, having come into use, became an art which was diffused throughout society. Cylinder seals, which were at once ornamental and practical, were very popular with the rising middle classes of the ancient Near East. The method of smelting was facilitated by casting in moulds, which made it possible to cast the ornaments and figurines of the Ancient Romans and the Greeks in large quantities and distribute them on a large scale. At first, books were expensive, but their prices gradually came down until they were affordable to the lower strata of society by the nineteenth century. Printing was a considerable development in Europe in the fifteenth century, when it began with small woodcuts, mainly religious. The images were often small, hand-coloured and cheap enough to enable them to be used to decorate the homes of even the poorest of the population. In 1661 the city of Basel in Switzerland established the first public museum of art, the Kunstmuseum, which assembles works of art from the fifteenth to the twentieth century. For centuries popular prints of all kinds have adorned the walls of homes and offices. Nowadays, however, art is almost exclusively the prerogative of the wealthy. The Kunstmuseum has established an international reputation for its paintings and drawings by artists active in the Upper Rhine area between 1400 and 1600 and for its holdings of works from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.", "sample_id": 52}
{"x": "“The art of the sixties and seventies is distinguished by a desire to transcend the buying and selling of art. During the sixties and seventies, a significant feature of the work of many artists was to produce works which were not made to be bought and sold like any other commodity. The prominent German artist Joseph Beuys formulated this desire in the sixties: ‘For the artist to produce a work that can be shown or shown and told is a perfectly legitimate aim.’ The idea that art should not be a commodity, was the driving force behind the innovations of the second half of the sixties, and a period when performances and concepts were much more important than material things, and the emergence of performance art, video art and conceptual art. But in the decades since, the original intentions of these movements have been diluted by the art market, which has learned to make a profit from these unconventional art forms, by selling limited edition DVDs of video art, offering special invitations to performances and marketing the leftovers of conceptual art. Many artists associated with the concept of art, and their conceptual art, eschewed the material form in favour of performance or publication, in order to underline the concept of the art object as a mere commodity. This development raises the question of the tension between artistic intention and market practice.", "sample_id": 53}
{"x": "In the early part of this century, the invention of the optical disc gave artists and galleries a new way to control the distribution of digital and moving images. The fact that the element of prestige has passed from the possession of art to the comprehension of art suggests that art is now considered a luxury commodity. Art has always been the cause of controversy and often provokes strong reactions. Many of the previous controversies have not been well documented and are now lost to our memory. This technology makes it possible for artists to sell their works in limited editions, thereby increasing the control they have over their own work. The content of their art may also be criticized, as in the case of some late medieval paintings showing the Virgin Mary as a drunk at the time of Christ’s crucifixion. In other instances, art has been condemned because of its depiction of people, groups or political parties who are unpopular. Artistic conventions, often supported by critics, are often conservative and uncompromising, although public opinion varies.", "sample_id": 54}
{"x": "With the coming of romanticism and the change in art production a certain ascendancy was gained by the artist in determining the subject matter of his works. This process led to a rise in controversy over the meaning of the works, although the importance of such controversy varied. There is a tendency towards a change in the subject matter of paintings from the realistic to the fantastic, a change that can be interpreted as a complication in the relationship between art and the public. In this connection there was a mutual dialogue between the artists and the public. The artist’s desire for originality and the public eye often led him to engage in controversial subjects.", "sample_id": 55}
{"x": "Gaut and Livingston have distinguished between two critical approaches: intentionalism and formalism. The intentionalists maintain that the interpretation of a work of art depends on the intentions of the author, the formalists that the work should be examined without any consideration of the intentions of the author. The fact of the creation of a work, while interesting, does not necessarily help in its interpretation. Towards the end of the twentieth century a significant controversy arose known as the linguistic controversy or the debate over the innocent eye,1 within the philosophy of art. Richard Wollheim stresses this attitude when he says: ‘The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, and this process must not be regarded as something beginning at the work but ending in it.’1 This view makes the intentions of the author an integral part of the work. Further confusion in the controversy surrounded the relation of language, interpretation and the perception of art.", "sample_id": 56}
{"x": "An illustration of this is the late development of Pop Art, in which the artistic revival of the post-war period, such as Andy Warhol, who took as his subjects not only the great masters but also fashion, comics, posters and pornographic art, which laid the foundation for the work of the subsequent generations of artists. In his book The Invention of Art: A Cultural History,1 Larry Shiner examines the history of the modern art system and especially the criteria by which art is distinguished from other kinds of creative activity. This raises questions as to whether there is any objective criteria that determine which activities today are considered to be art and, moreover, whether these are also socially constructed. The foundations of Pop Art can be seen in the ideas of Marcel Duchamp, who claimed that everything can be regarded as art. But Shiner maintains that the distinction between art and craft is a historical development that came about later in human history. He notes that ancient Greek society did not have a word for art, but for technology, which covered not only painting, sculpture and music but also cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy and farming. Art criticism and the definition of art, he claims, have both played a part in the development of Pop Art.", "sample_id": 57}
{"x": "That is to say, should the artistic intentions of the artist have any influence on criticism or evaluation? Or should a work of art be judged by its own merits, independently of the artist’s intentions?... The emergence of the New School of criticism aroused intense debate about this fallacy. It was this debate that prompted Wimsatt and Beardsley to publish in 1946 their controversial essay entitled “The Intentional Fallacy.” In it, they maintained that in literary criticism the work itself should be considered the only objective and genuine thing, while any external interpretation of the author’s intentions could be misleading and inappropriate. In the years that followed, the tenets of this view were challenged by theorists associated with the Reader Response School. Along with this essay, Wimsatt and Beardsley also published another, entitled “The Affective Fallacy,” which argued that in literary criticism one should not take into account the personal and emotional responses of the reader, which they saw as valid, objective reactions. The debates about the intentional and affective fallacies continue to have a profound influence on the whole field of literary theory and criticism. Notable figures like Stanley Fish, who himself trained as a New School critic, and who in his 1970 essay “Literature in the Reader” criticized Wimsatt and Beardsley’s views, were also part of the Reader Response School.", "sample_id": 58}

Such a shift in emphasis was of particular importance in the 1960s and 1970s, when Gombrich7 and Goodman,8 in his book The Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols,9 argued that the conceptual involvement with the work of art should be placed above all perceptual and visual experience.
