{"x": "In the West, the three classical branches of art are painting, sculpture and architecture. Art, a vast term, comprehends every human activity, and the resultant product, which is an expression of the creative and imagining talent, and which has the power of expressing beauty, sentiment, and intellect. It was a term of much broader import before the 17th century, when it was used to indicate all the possessed, skilled and mastered, and was not distinguished from the sciences and the handicrafts. In modern times, after the 17th century, when aesthetics has been made paramount, the fine arts are a group of very different kinds, and are distinguished from other, more general, kinds of skills such as the applied or decorative arts. The theater, dance, and other kinds of theatrical and dramatic art, and also literature, music, film, and other kinds of artistic media, are also included in the broader definition of art. From the point of view of the history of art, works of art have been produced from the earliest times, and in every culture, from the prehistoric, to the present day. Some thinkers maintain, however, that the notion of art as such, as applied to all societies, except modern western societies, is a term which has no relevance beyond the sphere of the Western modern civilization. Art and its related questions, such as the nature of art and the creation and interpretation of art, are studied in aesthetics, a department of philosophy.", "sample_id": 0}
{"x": "Through the ages, philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and Immanuel Kant have pondered the nature of art. There are many other meanings in common parlance, but all in some way deriving from the same etymology. In English the derivatives are artifact, artificial, artifice, medical art, and military art. In Plato’s Ion Socrates makes no reference to the disapproval of Homer in the Republic. Socrates says poetry is the gift of the muses and not a rational art. In the Phaedo, he eulogizes this gift and other divine insanities (drinking, lust, dreaming), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer’s great art and laughter. Aristotle said that epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry, and music were all imitation art, differing in medium, object, and manner. The Ion makes a case that Homer’s Iliad served in ancient Greece the role of the Bible in modern Christianity, that is, as divinely inspired literary art that can lead to moral guidance if it is properly interpreted.", "sample_id": 1}
{"x": "Lastly, these forms of literature are distinguished by the manner of their imitation—narration or character, change or no change, drama or no drama. The forms also differ in the object of their imitation. Comedy, for instance, is the dramatic imitation of the bad, the tragedy of the good. In the earliest seventeenth century the word “art” came to mean a fine art, or the practice of skill, to express the artist’s genius, to stimulate the audience’s aesthetic sense, to lead it toward the contemplation of higher forms of art. It was Aristotle who believed that the imitation of nature was a part of man’s nature, and constituted a distinction between man and the lower animals. Art is that which stimulates the mind and feelings of a person through the senses. The creative arts (art as discipline) are a series of creative activities, or intellectual activities, which bring out the expression of personal genius (art as activity), which contain a symbolical meaning, a thought, or a mood (art as experience). In this latter sense, the word “art” designates several things: (i) the study of the creative skill, (ii) the process of the creative skill, (iii) the product of the creative skill, (iv) the audience’s experience of the creative skill.", "sample_id": 2}
{"x": "Often, if a profession is practiced in a practical and common way, people consider it a craft and not an art; and, if used in an industrial or commercial way, it is considered an applied art rather than an art. In the view of certain scholars, such as Kant, there was a distinction between science and art; and science was taken as representing the domain of knowledge, while art represented the domain of artistic freedom. The art of today, for its part, is often employed for purposes other than those of creativity and self-expression. Some art experts have argued that the difference between art and applied art lies more in the fact that one judged the other to be better or worse, than in any actual difference between the two. Then again, craft and design are sometimes viewed as art. Art is, as philosopher Richard Wollheim put it, “one of the most elusive of the problems of culture.” In art, the aim may be to communicate an idea (as in philosophical, political, or religious art), to create a sense of beauty (as in aesthetics), to explore the nature of perception, to give pleasure, or to evoke strong emotions. But the purpose may also be none of these. A work of art may be a medium for the expression or communication of ideas or emotions, or it may be an experiment with and an appreciation of formal elements for their own sake, or it may be a mimesis or a representation of something.", "sample_id": 3}
{"x": "It was developed in the first half of the twentieth century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell, based on the ideas of Kant. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood advocated the idealism of art as an expression of emotions, and therefore that the work of art itself exists only in the mind of the artist. Leo Tolstoy considered art a means of indirect communication from one person to another. By way of contrast, the American artist Larry Shiner stated that \"art is not an essence or a fate, but something that we have made.\" The Scottish philosopher George Dickie defines a work of art as any work on which the members of a social institution known as the art world, as a community, have bestowed the status of candidate for appreciation. However, some modern thinkers have been influenced by Martin Heidegger and interpreted art as a form of expression of a society that develops the language of self-expression and interpretation. During the Romantic period, art became a special faculty of the human mind, equated with religion and science. The meaning of art is generally understood in terms of mimesis (representation of reality), narration (telling a story), expression, emotion, etc. Artistic activity is found throughout human history. The oldest piece of art, a carved shell by Homo erectus, has been dated at between 430,000 and 540,000 years old.", "sample_id": 4}
{"x": "Probably the oldest known example of art in Europe is the Giant’s Heel from the Einhorn Cave, which is 51,000 years old and is by the Neanderthals. Containers, which may have been used to store paints, have been found going back to 100,000 years ago. Many artistic traditions have their origins in the art of one of the ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, the Olmecs, Incas, Mayas. Stone sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs of the Upper Palaeolithic, 40,000 years old, have been found, but their meaning is often unclear because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. The first sculptures and works of art that can be identified, such as the Venus of Hohle Fels, were found in the UNESCO World Heritage site of Ice Age art in the Swabian Jura. They include carved animal and human figures and also the oldest musical instruments, all from between 43,000 and 35,000 years BC. They are the oldest centres of human art.", "sample_id": 5}
{"x": "Greek art, for example, was deeply inspired by a cult of the human form, and it developed a professional skill in capturing its muscles, its grace, its beauty, its correct proportions. Due to the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art has survived, and more of their influence has passed down to other cultures and to the present day. However, the classical realist tradition survived in smaller works by the Byzantines, and realism gradually grew in Catholic Europe. In the art of the western Middle Ages, a lot of attention was devoted to biblical and religious themes, and a higher opulence of the celestial world was depicted, whether by gold in the backgrounds of paintings, or the gold and glass of stained-glass windows and mosaics, or the idealized, geometrical, flattened forms of the figures. In the east, too, religion was the dominant theme in the art of the time. The rejection of all iconography in Islamic art led to the focus on geometrical motifs, calligraphy, and architecture.", "sample_id": 6}
{"x": "Chinese art varies from one dynasty to another. The art of the Tang dynasty, for instance, is simple, yet elegant, and tends to focus on landscapes and scenery, whereas that of the Ming is more lavish, and places a premium on telling a story through its composition and its composition. Chinese art is of a wide variety, and it is generally divided into periods according to the reign of the respective emperors. In the West, in the 18th century, the age of enlightenment saw the advent of an art form that depicted the physical world, and the physical world that was in full control of itself, like the work of William Blake, who depicted Sir Isaac Newton as the “Apollon Geometer” and of Jacques-Louis David, who offered a vision of a revolution. Japanese art also dates its styles according to the reigns of the respective emperors. Likewise, there was a close interplay between styles of calligraphy and painting. Towards the end of the 19th century, there were several artistic movements, such as academic art, symbolism, impressionism, and fauvism, to mention but a few. It was the romantics who rejected this trend, instead opting for the depiction of emotions and individuality, like those found in the novels of Goethe.", "sample_id": 7}
{"x": "At the same time, with the increasing expansion of the world market, there has been a corresponding influence of the oriental lands on the art of the West. Consequently, the boundaries of Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. cannot be maintained very much after the time of their invention. In the same way, in the 20th century, the West was also strongly influenced by the East. It was only in the XIXth century that Japanese woodblock printing, itself influenced by Renaissance painting, also affected the West. And later, African sculpture, under the influence of several anthropologists, entered the hands of Picasso and Matisse. Relativism became the only certain truth of art in the 20th century. In the eyes of the post-modern critics, the world culture and the history of art are only the forms of a constantly changing form, and can only be understood and learned with the help of irony and skepticism. The optimistic quest for truth in the second half of the 20th century was abandoned, and the idealistic unattainability of truth was a reality. In 1970, Theodor W. Adorno said:", "sample_id": 8}
{"x": "The work of art is not merely a representation of something; it is the reality itself. Martin Heidegger, a great German thinker, has, in his “Origin of the Work of Art,” distinguished art by the dual concepts of being and truth. In history, art and artistic skills and ideas have often spread by the way of trade. For instance, along the Silk Road, Hellenistic, Indian, Persian, and Chinese influences could freely mingle. With each new work of art that comes to a culture, the very concept of existence changes. The encounter of cultures and world views has also affected artistic creation. Examples of this are the multi-cultural port of Trieste at the beginning of the twentieth century, where James Joyce met writers from Central Europe, and the artistic development of New York City, the melting pot of civilizations. One of the most striking examples of this interaction is the Greco-Buddhist art. The creative arts are usually divided into more specific categories, usually along perceptual lines such as form, genre, style, and material.", "sample_id": 9}
{"x": "In the whole history of art, three great schools have been distinguished: the school of form, the school of content, the school of atmosphere. Form consists of the methods used by the artist and the physical constitution of the picture, especially in the non-semantic (that is, figurative) qualities of the picture, such as color, contour, size, mass, melody, space, texture, and value; form may include the principles of design, such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, juxtaposition, rhythm, and so forth. Philosophers almost unanimously reject this view, maintaining that the aesthetics of art lie outside of the material, technique, and formal aspects of the picture. Unfortunately, there is no consensus of terminology with regard to the informally artistic qualities. In short, formalism is the theory that all aesthetic properties are formal, that is, part of the artistic form. Subject and content are the essence of the picture. Intentionalism asserts that the content is determined primarily by the intention of the artist, that is, the subject, that is, the person or idea represented, and that the content is the subjective consciousness of the artist about the subject. Some authors distinguish between subject and content (denotative and connotative), others between meaning and significance. The sculptural composition of Napoleon on his imperial throne partly borrowed from the statue of Zeus at Olympia.", "sample_id": 10}
{"x": "Extreme intensionalism, like extreme formalism, is usually discarded, for the reason that art is ambiguous, the intention of the artist may not be known and, therefore, is not at all relevant. As with extreme formalism, its most extreme form, philosophers are usually disinclined to accept extreme intentionalism, for the same reasons: \"For art is more often than not multiple and ambiguous, and the intention of the artist is elusive, or perhaps unknowable, and, therefore, of no importance. For art depends not only on the artist's intention, but also on the social and material circumstances, on religious and philosophical beliefs, political and economic structures, and even on climate and geography. ” Lastly, post-structuralism is a view that sees the significance of art in the context of culture, in the ideas, emotions and reactions it causes. This context often equals the artistic technique and the intention of the artist, so that analysis proceeds as with formalism and intentionalism. Art can mean a cultivated ability and the mastery of a medium; art also means a developed and profoundly meaningful use of language to convey immediate or deep meaning. Art criticism also develops and advances with art. For art involves not only a conscious, planned act, but also a relationship to the material and a coming to terms with it, which allows thought to flourish. Art is the result of feelings, thoughts and observations.", "sample_id": 11}
{"x": "At the beginning of the century, the adroit paintings of John Singer Sargent were admired or criticized for their skilful technique, while almost at the same time the artist who was to become the great iconoclast of the age, Pablo Picasso, was finishing his classic training, at which he was brilliant.. The genius of execution was in the past, as it were, the inevitable part of art, which must be required for its success. The genius of execution was not less important to Leonardo da Vinci in his art than in all the other activities he carried out. Then came the conception of art, the example of Marcel Duchamp's Fountain, one of the first works in which the artist resorted to ready-mades, and did not exercise any skill recognized in the history of art, followed by the work of a child like that of Tracey Emin, or Damien Hirst, which, in addition, play with mass media. A current criticism of some works of modern art is that they allegedly lack skill.", "sample_id": 12}
{"x": "Hirst's fame is based on the fact that he is a master at shocking concepts. In most of his work he uses pre-existing objects. He gives instructions for the art to people he employs, but in many cases he leaves the execution of the art to a manufacturer. He himself rarely puts brush or paintbrush to canvas himself. The purpose of art has been very varied over the centuries, and it is not that it is “vague”, but that it has had so many different purposes. Many of the modern and contemporary artists, however, continue to be extremely skilled at drawing and painting and in creating works that are physically worked by hand. The different purposes of art can be divided into two main groups: those that are unmotivated and those that are motivated. The unmotivated purposes of art are those that belong to the essence of being human, do not relate to the individual or have no external purpose. Some of the unmotivated purposes of art are listed in the following form. The basic human instinct for harmony, balance and rhythm. In this sense, art, as creation, is something that a human being has to do by nature (no other species does that), and thus art is not just a means.", "sample_id": 13}

It often comes spontaneously, while appreciating art, music, poetry. - Aristotle. - Expression of imagination. - Albert Einstein. The most beautiful thing that can be experienced is the mysterious, and it is the basis of all true art and science. Jupiter's eagle [example of art] is not the concept of the sublime and majestic of creation, as logical (aesthetic) attributes to the object, but something else, which gives the imagination the opportunity to spread its wings over a whole series of similar images and evoke more thought than a concept fixed by words can express. Art is the means of expression of the imagination, not grammatical, not limited to the idiom of speech and writing. Words, like letters, have a meaning and are a chain of a meaning, and not art.", "sample_id": 14}
{"x": "In many cultures art serves as decoration or as a symbol in rituals, performances, and dances. Though these things may not have any particular utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists have found that they do have a meaning, within the context of a given culture. Immanuel Kant: ritualistic and symbolic functions. These things are not only inert, they often have a meaning which is cosmological in nature and has nothing to do with any particular person. Most scholars who have to deal with prehistoric rock paintings or other things which cannot be explained by their utilitarian purpose, and which are thus classed as decorative, ritualistic, or symbolic, are aware of the trap set by the word “art.” Silva Tomaskova The purpose of art, as a simple, utilitarian thing, is communication. The purpose of art is communication. The communication is political, a social commentary, a special expression of feelings, psychology, etc., illustrative, educational, selling, or simply utilitarian. But the communication is almost always directed toward a person, which means that it has a utilitarian purpose.", "sample_id": 15}

The art of transmitting a mood or a certain feeling to the viewer, for relaxation or entertainment. Steve Mithen Art is a symbolic medium of communication. Aims: to educate, enlighten, enlighten. This is often the aim of cinema, of video games. In contrast, the realistic and post-positivist spirit, from Saint Thomas to Anatole France, seems to me to be hostile to any moral or intellectual progress. Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, Abstract Expressionism, are what we call the avant-garde. It is this spirit which today produces these ridiculous books, these sneers. This spirit, which constantly feeds on the newspapers, is stifling both art and science, by assiduous attention to the ugliest taste: clarity and stupidity, the brute existence.

Deconstruction and subversion are almost the same thing as art for political revolution, except that they may inquire into a facet of society without any political goal. Art for social inquiry, subversion or anarchy. Art for social ends. Graffiti and other street art is the spraying and stenciling of designs on walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges in public places, generally without permission. Trash fashion, the fashion that makes use of garbage, as created by Marina de Bris, is an example of art that draws attention to the environment. Art is a vehicle for all sorts of awarenesses.

It has been argued that the brain has much more potential than the one necessary for survival in the ancestral environment. The purpose of art here is to gently lure the viewer into a certain emotional or psychological reaction to a particular idea or object. Art as a fitness indicator.

{"x": "The functions of art as indicated above are not mutually exclusive, and in fact some of them overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may be produced with the aim of promoting a product, such as a film or a game. In the first step of the process of art, the artist creates a mental image of what he is about to produce. Steps Steps in the process of art can be divided into any number of stages that the artist wishes to set down on paper, but as a matter of convenience the following three steps are taken here. Inspiration The inspiration for art may be based on instinct, impressions and feelings. Preparation for art may involve the choice of a subject and the study of the subject. With this in mind, the artist begins to conceive the appearance of the work. Creation Art is influenced by the artist’s mood, environment, and mental state. For example, the somber mood in the Black Paintings of Goya, painted towards the end of his life, is attributed to his life experiences, which were in a secluded part of the world. In the second step, the artist creates his work. Trial and error is considered an important part of this step. The influence of drugs such as LSD and cannabis has been attributed to some of the best works of the Beatles, for example Revolver. He painted them directly on the walls of his studio in Spain and probably never talked about them with anyone.", "sample_id": 19}

Although many people would judge an artistic work by its commercial success, art, in its capacity as a provider of social information and the means of promoting well-being, is of considerable value. Since ancient times, a great deal of the finest art has represented a display of wealth or power, with expensive materials used on an enormous scale. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious institutions, and lesser works have been the province of the most wealthy people in society. Art, some of it, has practical, scholarly, discursive purposes.

During the 19th century, the middle classes could afford even the cheap illustrative books. Printing has long been an important innovation. Today, the Kunstmuseum Basel has a remarkably wide span of history, from the early 15th century to the current present, and is a national and international museum of art. It was founded in 1661 in the Swiss city of Basel as the first public art museum in the world.

{"x": "There were special arrangements for the public to visit many royal or private collections in galleries, such as the Orleans collection in Paris, which was largely deposited in a wing of the Palace Royal, and could be visited for most of the eighteenth century. Many royal and noble residences were open to the public in certain parts, and much of their art collections were accessible to all, or to all who paid a modest fee, or wore the correct attire, regardless of who they were, as at Versailles, where appropriate dress—silver buckles and sword—could be hired from the shops outside. The Egyptian temples are typical in that the richest and most extravagant decoration is in the parts which the common people may see, not in the parts which are seen only by the priesthood.

All the modern museums and all the art instruction courses for children in schools have their origin in this drive to make art available to everyone. The building of the Prado, in which part of the royal collection is on display, was erected before the French Revolution, for the purpose of displaying it to the public, as were similar galleries in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. In America, museums are usually founded as gifts from the very rich to the masses. But a museum is not only a neutral stage for art, it plays an active and important role in the way art is perceived in our time.

The democratic principle that art is a commodity engendered an aesthetic revolution that came to fruition in the late 1960s and continued throughout the 1970s. The art was either performance art that leaves nothing behind, or the art of ideas, neither of which could be bought and sold. The art market has now come to the point where it can sell limited editions of video art, invitations to performance events, and the remains of the art of ideas. Under the name of 'conceptual art', an array of artists have tended to substitute performance and publishing for the material and materialistic concerns of painting and sculpture. They have sought to undermine the object as an object.", "sample_id": 24}
{"x": "Confrontation. Art has always been a controversial, that is to say, offensive, thing to some of its beholders, for a great variety of reasons. Most pre-modern disputes are so little recorded as to be lost to the view of modernity. With the widespread use of recording technology from the beginning of the present century, artists and galleries who earn their living from the sale of art gained an important means of controlling the distribution of digital works of art in limited editions to collectors. The concept of “understanding” art, rather than “owning” it, became the determining factor of one’s class, while the activity of viewing art remained, by definition, a privilege of the upper classes. Aniconism is a universal or at least exclusive aversion to the idea of figurative art, and has been a thread running through many major religions. It is a crucial factor in the history of Islamic art, in which a strong tradition of iconoclasm has been particularly virulent when it comes to depictions of the Prophet Muhammad. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and deeply held, but less seriously taken by the public. For instance, in the last centuries of the Middle Ages there was a great controversy over the new motif of the Virgin’s swoon in scenes of the Crucifixion. In many cases art has been discredited merely because it embodies or signifies unpopular rulers, parties or other groups.", "sample_id": 25}
{"x": "Hence the rage for originality and the demand for public renown, which frequently led to artists’ cavalier attitude towards controversy. The works of some artists are more or less confined by the art of painting to what they wish to express and show; but in more recent times the contents of paintings have been more or less fixed by the artists themselves. With the coming of Romanticism, and the changes in the way of producing art, the artist’s own point of view became the rule and thus the occasions for controversy, although not their consequence, increased. The gradual abandonment of naturalism, the realistic representation of appearances in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, resulted in a controversy that lasted over a century. E. Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l’Herbe was considered scandalous, not because the woman in it was nude, but because the men were dressed in the clothes of the time, rather than the costumes of antiquity. John Singer Sargent’s Madame Pierre Gautreau (1884) caused controversy because of the reddish colour of the earlobes, which was considered a titillizing colour that ruined the reputation of the high society model.", "sample_id": 26}

Leon Golub’s Interrogation III, with its naked female prisoner in a hood and her legs slit open to expose her sexual organs, was also highly controversial. Ruskin, whose aesthetic theories included a defense of J. M. W. Turner’s naturalism, believed that art’s mission was to impart to the viewer through the work of art an essence that was otherwise only to be found in nature. Prior to Modernism, European aesthetic theory emphasized achieving the proper balance between the ideal and naturalistic representations, a balance that was continually shifting over the centuries, and one that was largely absent from other traditions.

He applied the idea to the Abstract Expressionists and to the non-illusionistic, non-representational, non-representational, flat-painted works of the period. Modernism represented a radical change in the understanding of the functions of art; and so did the arrival of Postmodernism in the latter part of the twentieth century. From the followers of Greenberg, among them Michael Fried, T. J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock and many others, emerged several significant art theorists.

There is some evidence that this might have some truth to it. In The Invention of Art: A Cultural History, Larry Shiner studies the construction of the modern system of art, which is understood as the fact that only some actions are now regarded as art. He proves that the previous art system (before our modern art system) considered art as any humanly skilled activity, for example, the Ancient Greeks had no concept of art but techne, and the distinction between art and craft is a later historical construction. high art.

Art encompasses a wide range of human activities and their products, usually characterized by creative or imaginative talent, often manifested as technical skills, beauty, or emotional depth. The definition of art is always subject to debate, and varies widely from period to period and culture to culture. However, in its historical development, the concept of art (until the seventeenth century) did not clearly differentiate between the sciences and the arts, and has gradually become associated with aesthetics. In a wider sense, art includes the performing arts, such as theater, dance, music, literature, film, and the design of technology. It is a fact that art has existed as long as humanity itself, from ancient prehistoric art to modern art. The philosophical analysis of the art form and its implication in creativity and interpretation is the subject of aesthetics, and art criticism and art history. Of course, there are people who have argued that the concept of \"work of art\" may not be applicable to some civilizations, including those of the West.", "sample_id": 30}

Similarly, the dynasties of Japan are known by the names of the emperors, and their art is also known by the names of the emperors. It is especially the combination of calligraphy and painting that makes the Japanese art unique. The painting of the Ming Dynasty is also very lively, and it is full of fanciful settings and layers, and the painter will often tell the story through the scenery. In the West, in the eighteenth century, the enlightenment era began, and it was seen in the picture of the incarnation of Newton by William Blake and the paintings of Jacques-Louis David. After the seventeenth century, Japan's woodblock printing technique became popular and helped to spread the paintings. The nineteenth century witnessed the appearance of many schools, such as academicism, symbolism, impressionism and fauvism, which also formed a colorful picture of art in that period. It was the philosophy of Goethe, which was the essence of Romanticism, and there are more and more Chinese painters.", "sample_id": 31}
{"x": "The theory of form was developed by the aestheticians and critics of the early twentieth century, such as Roger Fry and Clive Bell. The neo-Kantian idealists Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood have further developed the notion that art serves to express emotions and that a work of art is essentially the creation of the artist’s mind. Leo Tolstoy described art as a means of indirect communication between people. Art, according to the American philosopher Larry Shiner, “is neither an essence nor a fate, but something we have made.” He observed that the concept of art as it is commonly understood in Europe today is a relatively recent invention, dating from the eighteenth century. Recent thinkers, influenced by Martin Heidegger, have understood art as a medium of self-expression and interpretation. George Dickie developed the institutional theory of art and argued that a work of art is any object designated by qualified individuals acting on behalf of the social institution known as the “art world.” The history of art dates from prehistoric times, from the shell engraved by Homo erectus some 430,000 to 540,000 years ago, which is one of the earliest examples of artistic expression. During the Romantic period, art began to be regarded as a distinct human intellectual activity, similar to science and religion. Art can be characterized by various properties: mimesis, narration, expression, and the communication of emotion.", "sample_id": 32}
{"x": "Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Kant, all of them delved into the subject of art, and the word art became the source of English words such as ‘artefact’, ‘artefactual’, ‘artef’, ‘medical arts’ and ‘the military arts’, etc. All these, in their various meanings, are rooted in its original sense. Plato, for example, in the Phaedrus, talks of poetry as a work of art rather than the product of reason, but without giving up his belief that it is divinely inspired, a divine madness, similar to drunkenness, eroticism and dreams. He is highly favourable to this divine inspiration, seeing it as akin to divine madness, drunkenness and eroticism. Socrates, in the Ion, does not show the same disapproval of Homer that he will later on display in the Republic. On the contrary, it can be seen that the Illiad was a divinely inspired literary work, the same role that the Bible plays in contemporary Christian culture: a divinely inspired work of art that gives moral guidance, if read correctly. But in the Republic, he does call for the banning of Homer’s poetic works and the performance of comedy. This betrays a complex relationship to artistic expression. Aristotle further widened the discussion of art, dividing the various literary genres into those that are imitative and those that are not. He saw epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry and music as the imitative arts, each distinguished by its own medium, its own subject matter and its own method of imitation.", "sample_id": 33}
{"x": "The oldest known work of art in Europe is the Giant Coral Knot from the Einhorn Cave, which is about 51,000 years old and attributed to the Neanderthals. Also, it is known of some 100,000 years old containers, which may have served as reservoirs for pigments. Small drill shells dating back 75,000 years were discovered in a South African cave, as well as containers for the manufacture of paint, which date back even further. But the first sculptures, the earliest findings of art, such as the Venus of Hohle Fels, were found in the UNESCO World Natural Heritage site Caves and ice-age art in the Swabian Alb. Various works of art, such as cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic period, were found dating back to 40,000 years. The meaning of these works is disputed, as little is known about the culture that created them. In this region, dating back to 43,000 to 35,000 BC, the earliest works of art and the earliest musical instruments were found. This region was the center of human artistic expression.", "sample_id": 34}
{"x": "Greek art was especially reverent towards the human form, being characterized by a development of methods that displayed the musculature, posture, beauty, and anatomical proportions, with a careful emphasis on truth. The long-lived and widely spread civilizations of the Ancients preserved many of their works and transmitted their artistic practice to succeeding civilizations, and notably they left the first records of the practices of the artists. By contrast, Byzantine and Medieval art in the West of the Middle Ages was primarily religious in subject, attempting to portray the divine through the use of gold backgrounds in painting, and glass in mosaics and stained-glass windows. It laid the foundations for the coming ages of art. The Renaissance began a return to the realism of the world, and a new focus on the earthly, the natural world and the human form. Byzantine and medieval art often preserved the classical realistic tradition, and slowly realism began to make inroads in Catholic Europe. These works tended to portray idealized, flat figures. In the East, Islamic art, especially Islamic painting, was characterized by its rejection of iconography, the focus being on geometric designs, calligraphy and architecture. Farther East, religion continued to dominate art, a reflection of its own cultural and spiritual values. In the West, realism had returned in the Renaissance, and artists began to experiment with methods to suggest three-dimensionality and depth.", "sample_id": 35}
{"x": "‘The different types of art are classified according to their subject matter and method of presentation. Thus comedy represents a dramatic imitation of people who are regarded as below average, tragedy above average. Fine art is often defined as the application of a skilful technique for the purpose of expressing the artist’s creativity, engaging the viewer’s aesthetic sense, or encouraging contemplation of more refined artistic works. The idea that imitation is an inherent part of human nature, distinguishing us from other animals, was ascribed by Aristotle. Art may also refer to a number of interrelated concepts: the acquisition of a particular artistic skill; the process of using that skill; and the final product. The field of art as a discipline embraces a number of different fields of creative activity that are motivated by personal expression (art as activity) and convey meanings, emotions, or symbolism to be interpreted by the audience (art as experience). The products resulting from the use of artistic skills. The experience of the audience in the presence of artistic skills. Essentially, art aims to stimulate our thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through our senses.", "sample_id": 36}
{"x": "A WORK OF ART is not only a way of expressing the truth of a culture, it is a way of creating the truth of a culture. The work of art not only expresses the truth of a culture, it also creates the truth. The history of art teaches us that the means of the most ancient artistic knowledge and of its development were generally spread by the mercantile routes. Every new work of art that comes into a culture alters the collective meaning of life. Intercultural communication has influenced the creation of art. The most characteristic example of this is the Silk Road, which mixed the Hellenistic, Persian, Indian and Chinese influences. Greco-Buddhist art is a characteristic example of this intercultural contact. The artistic creation is generally categorized into different forms, genres, materials and styles, usually on the basis of the perceptible differences. For example, in the first half of the 20th century, Trieste was a multilingual, port city that became a meeting point for the literature of central Europe, including James Joyce. It is useful to understand the enormous amount of artistic expressions by such categories.", "sample_id": 37}
{"x": "Through the increased intercommunications of the last centuries, the cross-fertilization of artistic ideas and artistic practices took place, with the result that a considerable influence from the various national and regional cultures was exerted on Western art. There are movements of art which emerged in the last century and early twentieth century, which could be identified with movements of the period. However, after the period of origin, it is no longer possible to maintain a close distinction between them. Opposite this, Western art exerted a strong influence on Asian and African art during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. One was the influence of Japanese prints, which were made in accordance with the artistic Renaissance, on impressionism and its successive developments. African sculpture also inspired Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, who also contributed to the development of modern art. The modernist art, characterized by the pursuit of truth, began to decline after the first half of the twentieth century, as the artist and theoretician realized the complexity and difficulty of the task, and as the philosopher and art critic Theodor W. Adorno put it in 1970: \"Nowadays, nothing is certain about art; neither art itself, nor the relationship of art to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist.\" This change of attitude had a great influence on the theory and practice of art in the East. Cultures and historical narratives are understood as something that has been evolving, and this can be appreciated through the ironic, skeptic view. This is the concept of relativism, which has become the center of the world's art.", "sample_id": 38}
{"x": "Among the most common attacks made on the theory of the author is the theory of the strict intention, which makes it imperative to know the meaning of a work of art. Philosophers often find this limiting, because an artistic work can have several meanings at the same time, and the intention of the artist can sometimes be unknown or irrelevant. The concept of a God beyond time and space, and the notion of a universality of meaning, often comes up in discussions of art and its interpretation. And so post-structuralism, a new theoretical framework, examines art within the framework of society, in terms of the thoughts, emotions and reactions elicited, but at the same time, with a certain awareness of formalism and intentionalism, also emphasises the intention and the methods of the artist. This, however, has led to claims that such an interpretation is “unhealthy, philosophically unrealistic and politically stupid”. Art criticism is a discipline that is continually evolving, like art itself. Religious and philosophical views, sociopolitical and economic conditions, as well as geographical and meteorological conditions, can all have a considerable influence on the interpretation of art. Conversely, material and historical circumstances may sometimes prevail. At its most basic level, art is the act of expressing thoughts, feelings and observations. Art can be seen as a form of skill, the means by which we convey meaning, in a straightforward or deep manner. An understanding of the material and of the process is often at the core of artistic expression. It develops through experience and it develops the artist’s thought processes.", "sample_id": 39}
{"x": "Philosophical views on art are divided into three: formalism, content-analysis, and historical analysis. Formalism deals with the artistic methods and the physical composition of art, concentrating primarily on the non-semantic features of colour, shape, dimension, medium, harmony, space, and value. The concept of form includes the compositional principles of order, balance, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and rhythm. As a conclusion, the analysis of art is a three-fold study that involves form, content, and context, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of artistic expression and its meaning. The terminology used for the non-formal features of art is not entirely unanimous: some philosophers call them the content and the significance, while others use the terms meaning and value.", "sample_id": 40}
{"x": "For example, Rembrandt, who is now celebrated for his fleeting qualities, was first and foremost appreciated for his technical mastery. The art of the past was the art of artifice, the art of Leonardo da Vinci and the art of cunning. In our time, a frequent criticism of certain modern artistic forms is that they lack the skill and technical expertise of their creators. At the beginning of the twentieth century, John Singer Sargent's highly skilled paintings aroused admiration and suspicion for their manual skill. At the same time, Pablo Picasso, later to be one of the most influential and important figures in modern art, was acquiring a high degree of academic skill. Later, in the nineteen-nineties, the \"new\" art became a criticism of the skill of the past. The recent examples of art by contemporary artists, such as the work of Tracey Emin My Bed and the work of Damien Hirst The physical impossibility of death in the mind of a living person, which are in dialogue with the art of mass media, are exemplary. Marcel Duchamp's Fountain is a good example, as it is one of the first conceptual artworks that use ready-made, discovered or thrown objects without applying the usual artistic skills.", "sample_id": 41}
{"x": "Starting from this innate talent, people gradually develop a creative imagination, ultimately producing poetry through their original improvisations. This is an instinct in the deepest nature of man, and Aristotle adds that a natural inclination towards harmony and rhythm exists in him, which the meter expresses. Albert Einstein says that the most profound experience of man is that of the encounter with the mysterious, which he regards as the basis of all real art and science. Art is a path to explore one’s relationship with the universe. This exploration is often spontaneous, especially in the performance of music and poetry. The imagination is a universal language, and the sense of the mysterious, of sublimity, of majesty, is conveyed through the imaginative expression of the art. Words express sequences of concepts and ideas, and they are difficult to interpret, but art allows us to invent and express a variety of concepts, which are free and flexible, not restricted by the syntax of language.", "sample_id": 42}
{"x": "In contemporary art, the process of making often consists in assembling ready-made materials, a practice which has become the hallmark of conceptual art. Damien Hirst, whose reputation is based on his ability to come up with daring concepts, delegated much of the execution of his works to master craftsmen. The purpose of art has changed considerably over time, making it difficult to identify a single definition of its purpose. This is not to say that art’s purpose is ambiguous, but reflects the diverse reasons for making it. Despite this tendency, a great number of modern and contemporary artists continue to perfect traditional skills such as painting and drawing, creating works which require handiwork. Art is thus seen as a fundamental part of human nature, as no other species is capable of artistic creation. As an anthropologist, Claude Levi-Strauss has suggested two kinds of purpose for art: the intrinsic and the instrumental. Therefore, in the case of art, the function is not necessarily instrumental, but is motivated by a fundamental human instinct towards harmony, balance and rhythm.", "sample_id": 43}
{"x": "The art is sometimes useless for a specific purpose; but it is admitted by the anthropologists that it embodies a profound significance. This significance is developed over generations, and reflects the cosmological relationship that is peculiar to each tribe. It is also used as a decoration or as a symbol in the rites, the plays, the dances. The driven purposes of art concern the conscious actions of the artist or the creator. The scholars who study the cave paintings, the prehistoric material whose utility is not understood, classify these works as adornments, rituals or signs, recognizing the ambiguity of the term \"art\", which leads to many interpretations. Art, in the last analysis, is a form of communication, and like other forms of communication, it usually has an intention or a goal aimed at a public, and thus a driven purpose. These purposes are: promoting a political or social cause, evoking certain emotions or states, referring to personal experiences, illustrating a concept, commercializing a product, communicating something.", "sample_id": 44}
{"x": "The aforementioned DDS is a tool for the diagnosis of emotional disorders. The DDS is a therapeutic method for assessing personality and emotional functioning. The DDS differs from conventional psychological methods in that the focus is not on the product but on the process. The product of this method is an artwork, which in commercial art is also the medium for marketing, and the aim is to evoke the viewer’s emotions and persuade him to purchase a particular product. Art as propaganda has long been used to influence public opinion and emotions. Artistic ability and creativity, according to one hypothesis in the field of evolution, may be analogous to the tail of the peacock, which in the eyes of potential mates serves as a sign of high fitness. This concept relates to theories of the runaway Fisher effect and the principle of the handicap. The function of the human brain has often been questioned, and the standard explanation is that the human brain has a greater capacity than the ancestral environment requires.", "sample_id": 45}
{"x": "Artists are called on to express their own ideas in a personal way and at the same time to be appreciated by others. It has been shown in the educational journals that reflection is a necessary part of the artistic process. The pleasure of art is often a source of great emotion, often because of its beauty. Discussions about art usually center around its commercial success, but it is more than that. Art plays an essential role in society by bringing information and contributing to the general well-being. Art has often been a manifestation of wealth and power, with a large scale and costly materials, often commissioned by kings and institutions. The bourgeoisie has usually reserved the less expensive ones. Some works are even intended to serve practical purposes, promoting critical thinking and stimulating conversation between the public. In short, art is many things at once, a personal experience, a societal task and a historical occurrence, thus demonstrating its relevance to societies and ages. However, there have been times when high-quality art has been available to the general public, especially with more durable media such as pottery, which can last a long time, as well as with more perishable materials such as textiles and wood.", "sample_id": 46}
{"x": "When the Louvre was opened in 1793, the Revolutionary Year, the foundation of the Louvre marked an important moment in the history of public access to art. The establishment of public royal galleries in cities such as Vienna and Munich was similar. The Prado, built in the country before the Revolution, was intended to accommodate the collection of the Crown. But it is largely from the need to make art accessible to everyone that the foundation of modern public museums and the initiation of school art classes come. These institutions are designed to provide access to art, but also to educate the public to a definite way of looking at it. This evolution is part of a wider tendency that has already been underway. In the United States, the establishment of museums is often the result of a wealthy individual making a gift to the public; the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York was founded by John Taylor Johnston, a railroad entrepreneur who was able to provide a personal collection as the basis for the foundation of the museum. Recent research shows that these museums play a significant role in determining the contemporary public's understanding of art.", "sample_id": 47}
{"x": "Conversely, art for social inquiry, subversion or anarchy, is not a partisan art, but the artist rather exposes and examines social phenomena, without a fixed political objective. The former expresses the attitude of society towards itself and its government; the latter, the varying aspects of the prevailing customs; the third, the relation of the two to the individual, and the last, the art of deconstruction and decomposition, the art of dismantling; the latter, the work of dismantled social organizations. Art serves as an important instrument in the field of social questions, and several artistic projects have been launched to highlight social problems such as cancer, human trafficking, the preservation of the oceans, the plight of the Darfurians, the murders of aboriginal women, the care of the elderly, and pollution. The graffiti can be a powerful tool for social criticism, but it is also a form of criminal act, as it is the case when it violates the laws against vandalism. Art is also considered a healing art, in the sense that it can cure, and has psychological value. A famous example of this is the fashion of trASHION, which transforms waste into clothes, a project that has been carried out by artists such as Marina Debris. Art is also used in the treatment of mental illnesses, and a number of artistic forms are used to support mental health, provide emotional expression and encourage personal growth.", "sample_id": 48}
{"x": "The creative process can be divided into several stages, though there is no agreement on the exact number. Artistic purposes are not mutually exclusive; they overlap. For example, art made for the sake of amusement may serve to commercialize, to promote a film or a game. The first stage of the creative process is a mental conception of the finished work, which leads to the creation of the work. The three major stages that follow are preparation, creation, and reflection. The second stage is the actual execution of the work. Preparation may also include research, the search for material, and gaining inspiration. Artistic inspiration may come from instinct, impressions, emotions. It is not always conscious. For example, the late works of Francisco Goya, the “Black Paintings,” were characterized by their dark mood, which reflects his isolation and his experiences of war. Goya painted them directly on the walls of his Spanish home, and it is said that he never talked about them with anyone. The process of experimentation and testing is often an essential part of the creative process, enabling the artist to explore and refine the work. The members of the Beatles, for example, have admitted that substances such as LSD and cannabis played a role in the creation of some of their most famous songs, such as those on the album Revolver. In sum, the creative process is complex, involving preparation, creation, and reflection, each of which contributes to the final work and the artistic experience. After a work has been completed, the artist will often reflect on it, pondering its impact and analyzing the emotions it has stirred. This process may also provide new inspiration for future projects.", "sample_id": 49}
{"x": "Even apart from temples, royal palaces, châteaux, and mansions of the higher classes of society were often accessible to the public. Egyptian temples are distinguished by the extent of their decorations, particularly in those parts which are freely accessible to the public. They contrasted with the austere sections reserved for the priests, which were not so open to the public. These privileged sites were sometimes closed to the public unless it wore the appropriate clothes, which the Palace of Versailles showed by letting visitors hire silver buckles and swords. These royal and private collections were frequently accessible to the public, either freely or for a small fee. In Italy, especially during the period of the Grand Tour, the business of art tourism became a very important industry from the end of the sixteenth century onwards, the governments and towns themselves promoting access to the most important works in their collections and thereby giving a cultural dimension to their tourist attractions. The Orleans Collection, which occupied a wing of the Palais-Royal in Paris, was for a long time accessible to the public.", "sample_id": 50}
{"x": "According to Steve Mithen, art is made up of artifacts and images laden with symbolic meaning and serving as a means of communication. Art often seeks to produce a certain emotion or mood, and to relax or amuse the beholder. Art is a multi-faceted means of communication, and enables one to communicate not only scientific ideas, but also emotions, moods, and feelings. Some 20th century art aimed to promote political change, such as Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, all movements known as the “avant-garde.” This purpose is especially evident in the industries of art, such as film and gaming, where the primary goal is to entertain. The surrealists, André Breton especially, rejected this attitude as mediocre, as a hindrance to science and art. Anatole France, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and Anatole France’s realism has been criticized for being hostile to intellectual and moral advancement. Art is often seen as a “free-zone,” a place where one is free to express their ideas, despite the social conventions.", "sample_id": 51}
{"x": "The cylinder seals, serving both artistic and practical purposes, were in great demand by the rising merchant classes in the Near East; the emergence of coinage and the development of coinage were phenomena that permeated various layers of society. Casting made it possible to make large numbers of pieces of ancient Roman pottery and Greek Tanagra figurines available to the public. Early on, books were expensive, but gradually the prices fell, so that by the nineteenth century they were accessible even to the poorest strata of society. One important innovation occurred in the fifteenth century, when woodcutting was begun, a technique that produced small, hand-colored prints, mostly religious in character, that even the poor could afford to display on their walls. In 1661 the town of Basel, Switzerland, established the first public museum of art in the world, the Kunstmuseum Basel, whose collection embraces the entire period from the early fifteenth to the present day. For centuries popular prints of all kinds have been hung in private dwellings and in public places. It is because of the highlights that it has achieved that it has an international reputation as one of the most important museums of its kind. It has a large collection of paintings and drawings from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries from the Upper Rhine area, and from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries from the German-speaking countries.", "sample_id": 52}
{"x": "At the time of this movement, a great impulse among artists was to produce art that would go beyond buying and selling. The German artist Joseph Beuys expressed this intention thus: “It is necessary to show something that is more than a mere object.” In earlier times, art had sought to resist commodification and not to be bought as a commodity by the wealthy for their use as ornaments. This wish that art should not be a commodity was one of the main themes of aesthetic innovation, beginning in the mid-sixties and lasting into the seventies. It was in this period that a great variety of artistic forms emerged: performance art, conceptual art, the art of the film, the art of the performance. The main idea behind all these was that art that is performance or concept cannot be commodified. It is however possible to say that in the decades that have followed, the original intention behind these forms of art has been overshadowed. Adapting to the new forms of art, the market has found a way to buy and sell them. Sales of limited editions of film, sales of performance tickets and sales of the remnants of conceptual art have taken their place. Artists of the concept often replaced the material form with performance and publishing, thus challenging the perception of art as a mere commodity. Yet this evolution raises questions about the constant tension between artistic intention and market forces.", "sample_id": 53}
{"x": "During the early years of the century, the introduction of a technology to record and save DVDs and other digital images gave artists and galleries a new means of managing the distribution of works. Art is now less of a sign of class than of comprehension, and a privileged circle is emerging around art. Many controversies of the past have been poorly preserved or have been lost to our understanding. Art has always been a cause of controversy, and in many respects the reactions of its public have always been strong and varied. This new technology has enabled the artists to sell limited editions of their work, and thus has given them more control over their own work. Artistic traditions, often supported by the critics, can be conservative and unyielding, and the reactions of the public to them may be wide-ranging. In art, the iconography of the work can also be a cause of controversy, as in the late medieval paintings of the swoon of the Virgin at the Crucifixion of Jesus. Art has also been subjected to criticism because of its presentation of unpopular persons, parties, or groups.", "sample_id": 54}
{"x": "One of the great changes which took place in art, from the time of the Romantic period, was that the chief determining factor in its production was no longer the artist but the sense of his vision, and the artist's vision was the mainstay of artistic content. The significance of this change of attitude to art varied from case to case. The gradual renunciation of realism in painting during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries gave rise to a long period of artistic controversy. The development showed the interplay between the demands of the world and the works of art, indicating the complexity of the relationship between art, society and public taste. The artists were excited by their desire to be original and to attract public attention, and thus were often led into controversial themes, as in the case of Theodore Géricault's and John Singer Sargent's works.", "sample_id": 55}
{"x": "Gaut and Livingston distinguish between two critical approaches, intentionalism and formalism. The intentionalists claim that a knowledge of the artist’s intention is essential to an exact understanding of a work; the formalists claim that the work itself should be analyzed independently of the artist’s intentions. It has not been shown that the manner of a work’s creation necessarily affects its proper interpretation. The last part of the twentieth century witnessed a considerable controversy, the linguistic controversy, also known as the innocent-eye controversy in the philosophy of art. In this controversy the view that the intentions of the artist are an essential part of the work’s meaning is expressed. Richard Wollheim expressed it in these words: The linguistic controversy is a controversy concerning the relations between language, interpretation, and perception, and it is one of the complicating factors in the conflict between intentionalism and formalism.", "sample_id": 56}
{"x": "It laid the foundation for a series of generations of artists of the eighties, nineties and noughties who expanded this critical approach to encompass the cultural production of all kinds of images—not just fine art, but also fashion images, comic strips, billboards and pornography. It was with pop art, which emerged in the middle of the twentieth century, that art itself, and the art world, was once again subjected to a kind of self-criticism. Pop art gained its momentum under the leadership of Andy Warhol. At the heart of this movement is the notion of art as a socially constructed category. In the essay ‘The Invention of Art: A Cultural History’,* by Larry Shiner, Shiner explores how the modern art system came into being, in particular the distinction between fine art and other kinds of creativity. The conceptual foundations of pop art go back to Marcel Duchamp, who declared that art is an activity that carries with it all the presuppositions of society. Duchamp argued that the distinction between art and other kinds of creativity, such as cooking, medicine, carpentry, cooking, riding, and prophecy, was something that came later in the development of human civilization. Shiner argues that ancient Greek society did not have a term equivalent to ‘art’, but had the concept of technique, which encompassed a broad range of human activities, such as music, sculpture, painting, and music, as well as cooking, medicine, carpentry, cooking, riding, medicine, horse-training, cooking, horse-breeding, cooking, cooking, medicine, horse-breeding, geometry, carpentry, divination and farming. That pop art, and the various movements that followed it, have been a complex entanglement between a critique of cultural production and evolving definitions of art, is evident from a general overview.", "sample_id": 57}
{"x": "The concept of intentional fallacy concerns the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist can influence criticism and judgment of his work. In other words, whether a work of art is to be judged for itself, independently of the intentions of the artist. The new criticism school led to a major debate over the concept of intentional fallacy. A decisive and controversial article entitled “The Fallacy of Intention” by William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley was published in 1946, in which they argued against the importance of the intention of the artist or the “intended meaning” in literary criticism. The text itself, they said, should be the sole subject of literary analysis, and that the extraneous meaning, i.e. the meaning of the author's intention, was a possible distraction and an unnecessary diversion. This concept was later contested by the school of reader response theory. At the same time, Wimsatt and Beardsley also wrote the article \"The Affective Fallacy\", which dealt with the role of the personal and emotional reactions of the reader in literary analysis, and said that these reactions were not to be considered a means of judging a text. The discussions of the intentional and affective fallacies continue to have a great influence on the theory and criticism of literature, and serve as a reminder of the tension between the intention of the artist, text analysis, and reader interpretation. Notably, a major figure of this school, who began his studies in the New Critics, Stanley Fish, in his 1970 article “Literature in the Reader,” criticized Wimsatt and Beardsley in his article “Literature in the Reader.”", "sample_id": 58}

The 1970s and 80s, when the 1960s were still in their heyday, argued for the significance of the concept in the understanding of art, for example, in the work of Ernst Gombrich and in the book of the philosopher Goodman The Languages of Art: An Approach to the Theory of Symbols, in which the most important emphasis was placed on the experience of thought in art, in its interpretation, causing an important shift in the interpretation of art and the history of the humanities. This view emphasizes that language is not only a transparent means of thought, something that was also observed by the philosophers Johann Georg Hamann and Wilhelm von Humboldt.", "sample_id": 59}
