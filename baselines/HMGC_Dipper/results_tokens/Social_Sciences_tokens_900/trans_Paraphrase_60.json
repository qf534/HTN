{"x": "economia is a term that designates the space occupied by the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services; and is in general defined as a social domain, and particularly the practices, vocabularies and material representations associated with the use and management of resources. An economy is a domain of production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. It is, therefore, a social domain, of interrelated human practices and operations, which does not exist in isolation. Economic agents are individuals, companies, associations, governments. These provide context, content, and the conditions and limits of the functioning of the economy. Production is the source of economic activity, the use of natural resources, labour and capital. Economic transactions are those between groups or parties, in the form of a mutually agreed value, generally expressed in a currency, but constitute only a small part of the economic domain. Throughout time, the economy has been transformed by technology, innovation (new products, services, processes, an increase in the size of the market, diversification, specialization, an increase in turnover), and changes in industrial relations (the elimination of child labour in some countries and the universalization of the right to education).", "sample_id": 0}
{"x": "It is not until 1650 that the sense of ‘economics’ acquired the most common currency, in the meaning of the ‘economic system of a nation or region’. The word derives from the Greek oikonomos, which signifies ‘household’ and ‘to manage’. This sense of economics dates back to the ancient world, to the Babylonians and the inhabitants of the city-states surrounding them, who established the first system of economics in the modern sense of the word, that is to say the legal regulations of debt, contract law and private property. Ever since people have been producing, supplying and distributing goods and services, there has been some kind of economy; economies have grown as societies have grown and become more complex. The earliest economies were largely agricultural, based on the production of crops and the hunting of animals. The Shekel was the first unit of measure and money, used by the Semitic peoples. The first judicial and administrative systems, with prisons, courts and records, were established. The first occurrence of the term comes from Mesopotamia, c. 3000 BC.", "sample_id": 1}
{"x": "Most of the goods had been exchanged in the social order. There were also some traders who did business in the market. The barley-shekel was originally both money and a measure of weight, as the British pound was at first only a pound of silver. In the history of the Chinese economy, we see a great cycle of institutional innovations, a thought. The debate on economics was originally driven by scarcity. In Ancient Greece, from where the English word “economics” is derived, there were many slaves who worked for landowners. In the Middle Ages, what is now called “the economy” was still quite close to survival. Most of the goods were exchanged in social groups. The service of a non-market economy requires a fixed-term job that is protected by law and safe from bureaucratic exploitation. The great conquests raised what is now called “venture capital” (ventura, Italian for risk) to finance their conquests. They had to be repaid by the goods they brought back from the New World. In 1513, the first Stock Exchange was established in Antwerp. The discoveries of Marco Polo, Columbus, Vasco da Gama (1469-1524), etc., led to the first global economy. The first business concerns were wholesale dealers. The European lands were part of the European states. These so-called colonies were branches of the economy.", "sample_id": 2}
{"x": "Europe’s secularization enabled the states to appropriate the immense wealth of the Church for the development of their cities. France, Great Britain and the Dutch Republic sought to control foreign commerce through import duties, and mercantilism (from the Latin mercator, ‘merchant’) was a first attempt to reconcile private wealth with the public interest. The nation’s financial intermediaries, such as Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773–1855), began to finance the country’s wars and capital projects. The influence of the nobility waned. The first secretaries of state for economic affairs took up their work. The first economist, in the true modern sense of the word, was the Scot Adam Smith, who was partly influenced by physiocracy, a reaction against mercantilism, and by the economist Adam Mare. He set out the basic principles of national economies: the regulated exchange of goods at their natural price, determined by competition, based on supply and demand. The national economy was from then on understood to mean the economy of a nation state. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) applied the principle of supply and demand to the problem of overpopulation. He maintained that the principal motive for free trade was the pursuit of self-interest, and the so-called ‘self-interest hypothesis’ became the anthropological foundation of economics.", "sample_id": 3}
{"x": "The Industrial Revolution was a turning point in history, a great transformation of society, a change in production, in distribution, in the division of labour. In Europe, the system of mercantilism was beginning to be replaced by wild capitalism, which led to a general increase in prosperity. After the devastation of two world wars and the Great Depression, policy-makers sought new ways of managing the economy; Friedrich August von Hayek (1899–1992) and Milton Friedman (1912–2006) who supported international free trade are considered to be the fathers of the so-called new liberalism. The concept of ‘the economy’ was not generally accepted until the American depression of the thirties. On the other hand, the views of John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) who advocated a greater role for the state in market-economics were dominant, and his theory of state intervention in the economy to ensure its smooth functioning and to promote growth is named after him: Keynesianism.", "sample_id": 4}
{"x": "The economy of the majority of the states is called the social market economy. In the book The Affluent Society, written by John Kenneth Galbraith in 1958, the term “The Affluent Society” was coined for the first time. The German term “Wirtschaftswunder”—“economic miracle”—was created, and a new form of economy, the economy of mass consumption, was born. Those who support this opinion point to the fact that the first application of this term in the English language was in a book written by the British sociologist Daniel Bell in the book The Coming of Post-Industrial Society in 1973, while others attribute it to the book Tools for Life, written by the German social philosopher Ivan Illich in 1972. The term was also used in philosophy to denote the decline of postmodernism at the end of the twentieth century and especially in the beginning of the twenty-first. The significance of the idea of a post-industrial society was enhanced after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transition of the states of the former socialist camp towards democracy and market economies. During the period from the end of the nineties to the turn of the century, the idea of the Internet and the information economy was created, and with the emergence of e-business and the digital economy, the term “global information society” was created to denote a new type of “everything-connected” society.", "sample_id": 5}

A market economy is a type of economy in which goods and services are exchanged according to the needs and supplies of economic agents, and which are interchanged by means of barter, or an exchange medium, generally a unit of currency, in which credit and debit value is agreed upon by the network. A planned economy is a type of economy in which the government directly controls what is produced and how it is sold and distributed. The global economy is the economy or systems of the whole world. A gig economy is a type of economy in which short-term, contingent work is assigned or selected on-demand. A green economy is an economy in which the growth in income and employment is caused by public and private investments in the reduction of greenhouse gases and pollution, energy and resource efficiency, and the conservation of natural resources and the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In the early economy, the main economy was based on agriculture. The stage of the industrial revolution diminished the importance of agriculture, turning it into a more extensive and monocultural agricultural economy in the last three centuries. An informal economy is not taxed nor monitored by any government. The development of the economy has been mainly in the areas of mining, industry and trade.", "sample_id": 6}
{"x": "In modern economies, these phases are somewhat differently portrayed in the three-sector model: Primary, which includes the extraction and processing of raw materials such as corn, coal, timber, iron, and the manufacture of goods, such as bread, pies, canned goods, and so on. Secondary, which includes the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into finished goods such as soap, candles, shoes, and so on. In the economy of modern consumer societies, there is a growing part played by services, finance, and technology, that is, by the knowledge economy. The other economic sectors of developed countries include: public sector or government sector (including: Parliament, courts, government offices, various services, public health, homeless shelters, transport facilities, airports, ports, maternity hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, monuments, public gardens, natural reserves, a few universities, national sport stadiums, national theaters, national cultural institutions).

{"x": "Because of the growing importance of the financial sector, the so-called'real economy' has become the term of choice among economists and politicians to denote that part of the economy that relates to the actual production of goods and services, and which is ostensibly opposed to the 'paper economy' or financial side of the economy, which is primarily concerned with trading on the financial markets. A traditional country's economic indicators are its gross national product and the per capita figures. Although a useful measure, these figures are based on the turnover of money. Today the range of subjects concerned with the economy focuses on the social science of economics, but can also encompass sociology, history, anthropology, and geography. Moreover, the old and venerable distinction between indicators in real terms, such as the real gross national product, and those in nominal terms, such as the gross national product, is still valid. The study of economics is roughly divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macroeconomics studies national and regional economies, and deals with the common indicators of income, production, employment, money, prices, international trade, and so on.

{"x": "This concept took on a new meaning at the time of the dot-com bubble, when the time of low inflation, high growth, and high employment created optimism and unsound business plans. Essentially the new economy is a development of the American economy. It has come about through the shift from the manufacturing economy to the service economy, accompanied by new technology and innovations. The economy began to slow down in the United States after almost 25 years of constant growth in 1972. A headline article in Time of that year, titled \"The New Economy,\" described the shift from heavy industry to a new economy, based on new technology. Since 1997, Newsweek had been referring to the new economy in many of its articles. In the period from 1972 to 1995, productivity per hour worked grew at an average of only 0.7% annually, but after that it rose significantly to an average of a quarter in the mid-1990s, which was 0.7% higher than in the three years from 1995 to 1999. It also had a high employment rate and low inflation. Economist Robert J. Gordon said, \"If we want to maintain high growth in the economy and also to keep inflation low, we have to transform the structure of production, investment, and money.\"", "sample_id": 11}
{"x": "The generally accepted Kondratiev wave theory for economic growth predicted that the ‘new economy’ will peak in the 2040s after 50 years. But he employed an altogether different method, relying on large-scale productivity increases during the business cycle in order to explain overall productivity growth. According to him, the benefits of the information revolution have been largely insignificant or even negative for the vast majority of companies, while they have been substantial for those operating in the industries of pc and durable goods, which make up a relatively small part of the economy. In financial terms, the term was associated with the dot-com bubble, with the development of a parallel stock exchange to the NYSE, with an increase in the number of initial public offerings, and the rise of dot-com stocks against traditional companies and the prevalent use of stock option schemes. The fundamentally innovative components of the new economy are the Internet, nanotechnology, telematics, and bionics. The stock market soared, as investment in high-tech companies rose dramatically. The term was associated with practices such as out- sourcing, BPO, and BPR. Where the companies were floated, their shares rose dramatically.", "sample_id": 12}
{"x": "Some, like Joseph Stiglitz and Blake Belding, have warned that the enormous investment in information technology, particularly in software and unused fiber-optics, is a waste. Some have even claimed that the old laws of economics are no longer valid and that new laws are taking their place. They also maintain that the improvements in the performance of hardware and software will fundamentally change the future, and that information is the most important value in the new economy. The 2001 crisis undermined some of the extreme predictions of the boom years and gave some support to the argument that the contribution of the computers had been overstated. However, the judgment may be harsh, given the strong investment in information technology in the United States since the second quarter of 2002. Despite the fact that there has been some overinvestment, it seems from the productivity analysis that much of the investment has been useful in increasing the value added.

The foundations of the new manufacturing economy: A rapid growth in the importance of digital technology, the Internet and the expansion of the world markets, as well as the development of information systems, are on the rise in manufacturing companies, as is reflected in the report on the fourth quarter of the year 2010 from PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Katz on the necessity of the so-called hubs of the high-tech industry, the digital service industry, the most agile start-ups, etc., but does not use the specific NME-term.

{"x": "It was introduced by Gérard Debreu in 1952. In the theory of economics, an abstract economy (or general N-person game) is a model which generalizes both the standard microeconomic model of a market and the standard game model of game theory. The irrational and non-complete preferences of Shafer and Sonneschein are an extension of this model. It was later on used by Arrow and Debreu (who renamed the game an abstract economy) to prove the existence of the Walrasian equilibrium. In the general case of Debreu's model, an abstract economy is defined by the following properties: It consists of a finite number N of agents; for each agent i a decision space X i (a set in R l), which represents the set of all the choices that the agent can make. The choice space is a random function, which is non-convex. A function from the choice space to the choice space, that is an inverse choice, A i : X  X i.

Another weaker assumption, which does not rely on the notion of graph continuity, is that the utility functions are quasi-concave at x i  x i and upper-semi-continuous at x  x. A related statement, which does not rely on graph continuity, is that each of the elasticity functions W i (x  i) := max x i U i (x i, x  ) is lower semi-continuous. This statement is proved by using the fixed-point theorem of Kakutani. We define the Cartesian product of all consumption functions as Y :=  j = 1 N Y j, or, more simply, Y :=  j = 1 N Y j, and for each i  l, a consumption set Y i := Y i (subset of R l := R l) : Representing the set of consumptions that the agent can have, if he is able to do so.

The market participant has a selection set X N:= , X N:=, a utility function U N:= p  (sum y – sum w i), and an action set A N (y, p) , where p is the price. It is intuitively understood that the market player sets the price so as to balance the supply and demand for a good: for a good for which the supply is greater than the demand, the right-hand side of the function U N:= p – (sum y – sum w i) is negative, so that the price is lower, and for a good for which demand is greater than supply, the value of the function U N is positive, so that the price is higher.

It is quite sufficient to suppose, for example, that none of the agents is satiated. During the proof it was assumed that V i  V i  y i, but this assumption is not really necessary; the proof remains valid even if the utility depends on the consumption of other agents (externalities), or on the prices. The result U n (y, p) := p  (sum y i - sum w i) means that the total consumption is equal to the total budget. Therefore, if the market economy meets these three conditions, it is in equilibrium.

Mas-Collel added that P i (x) is not empty (which is nonsaturation). To the reduction that proceeded from the Arrow-Debreu market to the Debreu market-makers, a similar “market-maker” reduction is available from the generalized market-makers of Mas-Collel to the generalized Shafer-Sunneschneschnei market-makers to the generalized abstract economy of Shafer-Sunneschnei.

{"x": "According to Matthew J. Crawford, “Attention is a scarce resource, a person has a limited supply of it.” Thomas H. Davenport and John C. Beck add to this definition, “Attention is the concentrated mental engagement with a particular piece of information. Attention economics is a managerial approach to the organization of information that treats human attention as a scarce resource and applies economic theory to solving various information management problems. Attention allows us to filter information, so as to extract the most important information from the outside world, and to ignore the less important details. The most important effect of this is that it limits the mental ability of a person, and also limits the ability to accept information. We know things, we pay attention to one thing, and then we decide whether to act or not. What is important is that, whether it is explicit or implicit, when designing the user's side of the system, we must consider the attention economy, because if the system takes too long to find it, it will be found by another program. For example, by setting up filters, we can show the most relevant information, pay attention to the things we are interested in, and know the past browsing history, which is also the attention economy.", "sample_id": 26}
{"x": "Theory From the research of a number of different disciplines, psychology, cognitive science, neuroeconomics and economics, it seems that people have limited resources that can be used at a time; when they are allocated to a certain task, there are fewer resources available for other tasks. Since attention is a mental process that is used to selectively concentrate resources on one particular piece of information, the resources that are used to pay attention can be considered as a limited resource. Erik Brynjolfsson, Seon-Tae Kim and Joo-Hee Oh show how this leads to the formal study of the attention economy and the valuation of free goods. It was the economist and psychologist Herb Simon, who wrote in 1971 that in a world rich in information, the wealth of information creates a shortage of what it consumes, which is logical: the wealth of information is in inverse proportion to the wealth of attention, and in turn the wealth of attention creates the poverty of attention and the need to allocate attention efficiently to the many different sources of information that are consuming it.", "sample_id": 27}
{"x": "In some cases the proposition that “attention transactions” may replace “monetary transactions” as the focus of our economic system has been made. Also, system planners and designers have begun to try to develop mechanism designs that exploit the notion that attention is a property right. According to the digital culture researcher and writer Kevin Kelly, by 2008, the modern attention economy was increasingly becoming a market where the reproduction costs of a commodity were negligible, and where the suppliers’ task was to enclose it with valuable intangibles that could not be reproduced.

{"x": "But giving too much attention to such social contact can result in a social interaction overload, i.e. a condition in which the people are overwhelmed by the amount of social interactions they must deal with, for example, in the context of social network services, where the people are subjected to a high level of social solicitations. One way to see long-term attention is to think of it as the attention people dedicate to managing their relationships with other people. Social attention can also be associated with the collective attention, i.e. the attention that is aimed at common matters, e.g. in public debates. Digital media and the Internet make participation in this economy easier by creating new distribution channels for attention, where even the ordinary people are able to reach a large audience by publishing their own content and commenting on the content of others. In advertising, attention economics treats a potential customer's attention as a resource. The traditional media marketing model used to assume that the consumers progressed through a linear process, which they called AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action). During the digital media revolution, it has become apparent that “a large number of people are paying attention to the same news items simultaneously” and that “the attention of large populations propagates to new information and subsequently fades.”", "sample_id": 29}
{"x": "The current meaning of the word, meaning ‘the system of economy of a country or a region,’ first began to appear in the sixteenth century. The word ‘economy’ derives from the Latin, which originated in the Greek words oikonomos and oikonomia, from which the first part of the word, oikos, means ‘household’ and the second part, nemein, means ‘to manage’. Among the first large-scale economies is Sumer, which developed a system based on the exchange of goods. With the development of human societies and the diversification of their activities, their economies have grown and become more complex. The Babylonians were among the first to create a state system based on law, with its own court system, prisons, and a system of records. Among the laws and regulations they introduced were laws concerning debts, the rules of business, and concepts of private property. Then came Babylonia and its neighbouring city-states, which set the foundations of a system of economy resembling modern economics.

{"x": "An economy is a system which includes production, distribution, trade and consumption of goods and services in a particular place. It is in general a social activity which is characterized by the practices, speech, material expressions and ideas which constitute the way of using material resources, and in this sense it is a domain of the human world, which has to do with the management and use of material resources. In the economic sphere, therefore, economic agents are a man, a company, an association, a state. These elements give a context and a structure to the economy, which in turn is characterized by the cohesion of human activities and actions. Production is the basis of the economy, which involves the use of natural resources, labor and capital. Monetary transactions occur when two parties agree on the value of a good or service in a currency, but they represent only a part of the economic landscape. Evolution, therefore, has also meant an expansion of the market, diversification and even the change in the way of working, as, for example, the way of exchanging child labor for universal education.", "sample_id": 31}
{"x": "It is called the industrial revolution because of the advance in production, and the division of labour which made it possible to produce in large quantities. In Europe, capital was starting to replace mercantilism, and the beginnings of the industrial revolution were at work. In the aftermath of two world wars, and after the disastrous economic crisis of the great depression, a new doctrine was called for, and was found in the teachings of economists like Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman, defending free trade and often regarded as the founding fathers of neoliberalism. The concept of economy as we know it today was born in the wake of the American great depression of the thirties. For the first time, the concept of the golden mean was applied to the system. On the other hand, in this period, the prevailing doctrine was that of John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946).", "sample_id": 32}
{"x": "The modern economy is being represented by a division into three separate branches: one involving agriculture, another involving industry, and the third a combination of the two. The three branches in modern societies are: finance, commerce, industry. The complexity and diversity of these branches shows the weight of services and knowledge in modern economies. There are also many other branches besides these three, which show the complexity and diversity of modern economies.", "sample_id": 33}
{"x": "It was at this period that many bankers, such as the Rothschilds, were called upon to give up their foreign affairs to their national governments, and their great Banks like that of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1773–1855) were made the principal patrons of the wars and the civil works. And the idea of mercantilism came to be gradually extended to the entire domain of the national government, and the economy was included in the domain of the state. This is the real reason why Adam Smith is often called the first economist. He was an opponent of mercantilism and, in an attempt to deal with it, he laid down the fundamental elements of the national economy. The birth of the concept of a state economy dates from the Industrial Revolution. Later, Thomas Malthus applied these laws of supply and demand to the question of overpopulation. Adam Smith made it the fundamental principle of economics that all economic activities proceed from the human need to make profits, and he believed that goods were offered at their natural price, which was determined by competition, the division of labor, and by competition. His works contributed to the understanding of the relations between the population and the resources of the country.", "sample_id": 34}
{"x": "In ancient society, exchanges were made mainly by personal acquaintance and in the market-place, by barter. In ancient Greece, from whence the modern term “economy” derives, there were bond-slaves, as in ancient Egypt. The shekel of Egypt was both a unit of currency and of weight, as the English pound originally meant a certain weight of silver. In the Middle Ages, the exchanges were largely of a subsistence character, and were mostly within the circles of kinship. During this period, economic discussions were often influenced by the conception of scarcity. The Chinese law of Wô introduced the idea that a non-market economy could allow the free evolution of institutions, thus protecting the firm from bureaucratic exploitation. The discoveries of Marco Polo, Columbus, and Vasco da Gama, led to the establishment of a worldwide economy. The chief remuneration of the great conquerors of the Middle Ages was based on the use of what is now called “venture capital,” from the Italian word for “risk,” the expectation being that the risk would be repaid by the profits to be made from the newly discovered countries. During this period, the term “economy” was mainly applied to trade, the European conquests resulting in the establishment of colonies, which served as appendages to European states. The first businesses were commercial; the first stock-exchange was established at Antwerp in 1513.", "sample_id": 35}

The economic system that developed during this period is called social market economy or the market economy with a social safety net, which combines free enterprise with a range of social measures aimed at ensuring fair competition and the maintenance of a level playing field. The advent of the Internet as a medium of mass communication, especially after the turn of the century, further transformed the economic landscape and facilitated the emergence of a new information society, which is characterised by increasing interconnectedness, digital communication and information exchange. Some scholars believe that the term post-industrial society was first used in Daniel Bell’s 1973 book “The Coming of Post-Industrial Society”", "sample_id": 36}
{"x": "A market economy is characterized by the production and exchange of goods and services, with demand and supply determining prices. Traders, known as economic agents, engage in such exchanges through barter or money. An economic system may be classified into different categories depending on its structure and function. In a planned economy, the government or a group of economic agents controls the production, distribution, and prices of goods and services, and the system aims to allocate resources in a predetermined manner rather than according to market forces. In a market economy, the prices of goods and services are determined by the market. It is a system that is based on the division of labor, with laborers being free to choose their employers and the terms of their employment. In a sharing economy, short-term, flexible employment opportunities are offered through digital platforms. A green economy is characterized by low carbon emissions and resource conservation, and in this system, the growth and employment are mainly created by the public and private investment to reduce pollution, promote energy saving, and protect natural resources and the environment. The world economy is the aggregate of all national economies, and it reflects the economic activities and interactions between nations. In this economy, workers are employed by companies mainly on a short-term, as-needed basis, rather than on a long-term basis. The development of economies can be seen in a number of historical phases. The informal economy refers to the economic activities that are not regulated or taxed by the government. The activities range from street vending to unregistered businesses. The first phase was characterized by subsistence farming, with households primarily engaged in farming to meet their basic needs. During the second phase, a shift occurred toward intensive mono-crop farming. The phases show how economies develop as the needs of society change, and as technology develops. This period saw the emergence of mining, building, and manufacturing industries, which were to play a critical role in economic development over the next three hundred years.", "sample_id": 37}
{"x": "In recent times, the term ‘real economy’ is often used by economists and policy-makers to designate that part of the economy concerned with the actual production of goods and services. The economy of a nation is usually analysed using various economic indicators, including GDP and GNP per capita. But, though these indicators can give an idea of the economic performance of a nation, they only take into account economic activities where there are monetary transactions. The indicators can be divided into two main categories: real indicators, which are corrected for inflation (GDP deflated by the rate of inflation), and nominal indicators, which are not corrected for inflation. It is this distinction that makes it possible to determine economic performance over time. By contrast, the ‘paper economy’, or financial economy, comprises the financial sector and the activities concerned with buying and selling on financial markets. All the branches of economics, such as business, industry, government and health care, take part in the production, distribution, exchange and consumption of goods and services. While the study of economics is primarily a social science, there are a number of related social sciences, such as sociology, history, anthropology and geography, which also make important contributions to the understanding of economic phenomena. All these disciplines contribute to the study of macroeconomics, the study of the macroeconomic conditions of nations, regions or groups of nations. Among the most important macroeconomic topics are: national income, national production, money supply, employment, prices, international trade and other significant economic issues.", "sample_id": 38}
{"x": "After a prolonged period of slowness which began in 1932, the American economy, after 1895, was advancing rapidly. The term “new economy” was made popular by an article in Time Magazine in 1983. The term was popularized during the late nineties in the course of the dotcom bubble, a time of high growth, low inflation, and full employment, which in turn led to an optimistic forecast, if not to unrealistic business plans. In the years from 1972 to 1995, the average growth of the rate of output per hour worked was around 1% per year. Between the years of 1995 and 1999, however, this figure increased to 2.6%. This progress was largely due to a rapid rise in productivity. Robert J. Gordon, an economist who was studying the New Economy, analyzed its effects and the reasons for its development. During this time, employment rose and inflation fell.", "sample_id": 39}

Gordon argued that the economic benefits of computers are mainly concentrated in the computer-related and durable goods manufacturing sectors, which represent only a small fraction of the national economy. In the long-term perspective of the Kondratiev theory, according to which long cycles occur in economic growth, the current economic era, called the new economy, is a cycle of Kondratiev waves that is expected to end in the 2040s. According to this theory, the so-called “new economy” is now entering a new era that will be concluded in the 2040s and which will be characterized by a series of innovations in the fields of the Internet, nanotechnology, telematics, and bionics. This era is also characterized by the emergence of the NASDAQ stock exchange as a major competitor of the New York Stock Exchange, by the number of IPOs, by the sharp rise of the dot-com stocks compared to stocks of other companies, as well as by the use of financial instruments such as stock options. The term \"dot-com\" is often associated with the \"dot-com bubble\"—the period when the price of dot-com stocks was soaring during the last decade of the twentieth century. Significant capital was invested in the technology sector, which led to a dramatic rise in stock prices. During this time, many new companies were created and often went public at a high price. In the broader context of the economy, the dot-com era is associated with the phenomena of business process outsourcing, business process re-engineering, and \"outsourcing. \"", "sample_id": 40}
{"x": "“Man, Economy, and State” is a work in Austrian economics, written by Murray Rothbard, the prominent American economist and political theorist. The work, divided into several chapters, is a comprehensive exposition of the principles of economics, with a special emphasis on the role of individual action and human choices in economic affairs. The author analyzes a wide range of economic phenomena, including the operation of the market, the role of prices, and the role of capital. He emphasizes that the basic economic concept is based on the idea of personal choice. Furthermore, Rothbard presents an extensive critique of state intervention in the economy, which often leads to inefficiencies and unintended consequences. The role of private property and free exchange is essential for economic cooperation and growth. 4. “Man, Economy, and State” is a significant work in the economic literature that gives insights into the nature of human action and market processes. It has served as a stepping stone for many Austrian scholars to develop their own theories of the role of the economy, entrepreneurship, and personal choice. “Man, Economy, and State” has also been very influential in libertarian thought and has been subject to both positive and negative criticism. However, its arguments are still relevant today in the context of the current debate on the role of the economy and the state.", "sample_id": 41}
{"x": "Joseph Stiglitz and B ake Belding are two economists who have expressed skepticism towards the potential of a massive investment in information technology, in particular in the development of software and the unutilized fiber-optics of the last century. In recent years, however, economists have become increasingly inclined to suggest that economic laws have been overturned and that new laws have been discovered under the conditions of the rapid evolution of digital machines. They affirm that the advance of computers, their hardware and their software, will change the economic law of the future, and that information will be an important resource in this new form of organization. The realization of the fruitfulness of information technology may be overrated. According to studies on productivity, the value of many of these investments may have been reduced in value. But some of them have a high probability of not bringing the anticipated returns. Even though we continue to debate the impact of information technology on economic theory, it is clear that the relationship between technological investment and productivity is complex and many-sided. However, the 2001 crisis has undermined some of the most extreme predictions of the boom, and economist Robert Gordon has supported the idea that the contribution of digital machines to the development of productivity has been overestimated.

{"x": "In theory, an abstract economy is a game which represents the fusion of microeconomics and game theory. An equilibrium in such a game is a combination of the Nash equilibrium in microeconomics and the Walrasian equilibrium in game theory. This model combines the characteristics of microeconomics and game theory. Shafer and Sonnenschein extended these results to non-transitive and incomplete preferences. This model was introduced by Debreu in 1952, when he named it general game, and proved that it has equilibrium, and then together with Arrow renamed it the general economy and showed the existence of the competitive equilibrium, that is the existence of the Walrasian equilibrium. In the model of the general economy, there are a certain number N of agents. For each agent, there is a decision set X_i (a subset of a Euclidean space Rn), which is the full set of possible choices of this agent. The choice of all agents is the scalar product, X: j=1N X_i. The choice correspondence A_i : X rightarrow X_i represents the relationship between the decision set of the agent and the set of his choices. With this approach, it is easy to understand the interaction between the agents in the economy and to explore the conditions of equilibrium and the structure of preferences.", "sample_id": 44}

The NME combines the networks, the three-dimensional printing, and the various new advanced capabilities with its industrial strategies to improve manufacturing practice. The main features of the NME are a strong focus on technology, expansion geographically, on information technology, and on e-business. Thomas Friedman for example cites Lawrence Katz, whose work on a new economic model in which universities, high-tech manufacturers, IT service and service suppliers, and agile start-ups work together. And although the term NME is not used, the concept is closely related to the NME concept. New developments in technology are having an effect on a whole range of industries and there is a greater emphasis on innovation as a crucial business tool.

{"x": "In economic theory, a market participant is represented by a choice set (XN = ) whose contents represent all the possible prices. Utility is the sum of the sum of y - sum of wi for all p. It is necessary for an exchange economy to be in equilibrium for certain conditions to be fulfilled. If the supply of a good exceeds the demand, then the right-hand side of the utility function, U N (y, p), is negative, indicating that the price should be lower, and if the demand exceeds the supply, then the price should be higher. These conditions are met when the abstract economy is in equilibrium. In particular, each consumption set (Yi) is dense and convex, and contains the beginning of the current W.

{"x": "It is assumed in economics that every agent is dissatisfied. The choice of the individual agent is thus delimited by the expression A(y,p) which means that the choice of the individual agent does not exceed the budget. Thus, if an economy satisfies these three conditions, it will be in a competitive equilibrium. Besides that, the utility function U  V indicates that the consumption of each agent is regulated so that the individual consumption is optimum within the budget limits. Finally, the expression UN(y,p) defines that total consumption equals total income. In the generalized model of Shafer and Sundenschein, the individual agent i is characterized by the following constituents: - the set of choices X i as previously defined. - the mean utility  i, for which the expression U(y,p) is given by the consumption of the individual agent, or by external conditions. - the mean consumption of the other agents, - the mean price of the final goods. This system enables a more differentiated view of the behavior of the agent in the exchange economy and makes room for a variety of forms of preferences and constraints. - a set of restrictions X i  X i which indicates the possibilities of the agent. - a preference function P i  X i which reflects the preferences of the agent on the choices of the individual agent.", "sample_id": 49}

Utility function, denoted by U_i, is the satisfaction given by the action for a given agent i. In other words, U_i is the measure of the subjective value each agent places on the action he takes. For an equilibrium to exist, there must be, for each agent i, an action x_i' in A_i(x) for which U_i(x_i, x_i)  U_i(x_i). In mathematical terms, this condition is: U_i(x_i, x_i) = max_x_i  U_i(x_i)  U_i(x_i) 4. Each utility function U_i is continuous at x and approximately concave at x_i. 5.

{"x": "The model of Debreu, as we have said, represents a special case of the generalized abstract economy. In the latter, the relationships of utility and preference are not expressed in terms of utility functions. Thus, in the model of Debreu, P.i.

A generalized abstract equilibrium is defined as a sequence of choices, x = (x_1, x_2,..., x_n): 1. where x_i belongs to A.i. (x) 2. for each agent i it holds that x_i belongs to P.i. (x).

{"x": "—Matthew Crawford says: Attention is a resource, a person has only so much of it. — Attention economics is a doctrine of managing information which considers attention to be a limited resource and to apply the principles of economy to all the problems of information management. This theory is based on the recognition of the limits of human cognition. We encounter various items of information, selectively pay attention to some of them and then decide to take action on this information. The process of selecting allows the individual to extract the most important items from the environment and to disregard the rest. Often the principles of attention economics are incorporated in the design of a program. In order to optimize the user experience, filters are created in the program that display only the information that is most relevant to the user and that best suits his preferences. This personalization is intended to facilitate the exchange of relevant information and to optimize attention and interaction. The logic of this is that if the information is not available quickly, the person will switch to another program.", "sample_id": 53}
{"x": "When the solution of the economic problem is the distribution of resources among the agents, the question of their choice is also involved. The compensation of the equilibrium is the method of understanding the preferences of the individual agent, the assignment of the resource, and the relationship between the choice of the individual and the budget. The substitution of the budget is based on the fact that if an agent prefers a bundle of goods, he can always afford it; if he is indifferent, he cannot afford it. To summarize, the principles of compensation of the budget and Pareto-optimality are the basic tools for analyzing the preferences of economic agents and for distributing resources in a market economy. A Pareto-optimal solution is an assignment that cannot be improved without making at least one agent worse. A Pareto-improvement is an assignment that a subset J of the agents is strictly better for them, while the allocations of all other agents are unchanged.", "sample_id": 54}

Information systems scholars have also been embracing the concept, examining the question of establishing property rights in attention and the problems posed for both producers and consumers. This is because it is extremely easy to duplicate these products.

{"x": "This reduction leads to the following conditions being sufficient for the existence of a competitive equilibrium in the generalized exchange economy: 1. The market maker’s’ reduction developed in this article, which represents a transition from the Arrow–Debreu exchange economy to the Arrow–Debreu abstract economy, is analogous to the Mas–Colell generalized exchange economy and the Shafer–Sonnenschein generalized abstract economy. 2. For every bundle x, the set P_i[x] is convex and does not include x itself, which is irreflexivity. 3. The set of relative preferences i is relatively open, which is equivalent to saying that the preference relation P_i has an open graph. 4. Mas–Colell have added the condition that the set P_i[x] is not empty, which ensures non-saturation. To show the failure of existence when the graph is not open, we consider an economy with two goods, say apples and bananas, and two identical agents with endowments w and w’. For each i, the initial endowment w is preferred to some x (w’ gg x’) and thus lies within the interior of the choice set. The interior is the inverse of the graph of the preference relation P_i. Now suppose that w’ is more preferred to some bundle x than w. In that case, no competitive equilibrium is possible.", "sample_id": 56}

In the field of advertising, the concept of attention economics is the study of how the attention of consumers is a scarce and valuable resource. The concept of collective attention is the study of the spread of attention for a new phenomenon, and its eventual diminution, in a large population.

{"x": "For the sake of demonstrating the principles, let us assume for the sake of contradiction that the equilibrium state does exist.

The corresponding quantities for each of the participants in the game must be lexicographically at least (x 1), thereby implying that the quantities for both are x. When the price of apples is set at one, and the price of bananas is p (where the price of apples is also set at 1), then both can afford the combination (1, p). If the price of bananas is zero, then the quantity of each of the participants in the game can be (x 1). Fon and Otani have extended the theorems of ngel to the generalized economy described by Mas-Colell. The combination (x 1) is also strictly better than the combination (1, 1). In both cases the proposed price cannot be regarded as an equilibrium price. There are a few important assumptions in the process.

{"x": "A phenomenon that has become known as “information overload” has impaired decision-making. In the face of the possibility of obtaining greater profits than the cost of comparison, individuals search for new products with the hope of obtaining higher profits than the costs incurred. As a result, consumer attention has become a scarce and valuable resource, which has to be carefully rationed. Approaching the problem from this point of view, we might regard the advertising and other forms of commercial information as detrimental externalities. They might be seen as a form of pollution or “toxic waste”. Advertisers have been accused of committing “theft of attention” for the purpose of unsolicited advertising. A market-based solution to the externalities problem was proposed by the economist, Ronald Coase, in his classic article “The Problem of Social Cost”[26]. A classical example of an externality in economics is water and air pollution, which impose costs on society and the environment, and which economists have long regarded as a social cost. By applying a similar concept to information pollution, it might be possible to find a means of balancing the interests of consumers and advertisers and thereby reducing the adverse effects of excessive information. This concept was originally introduced in a pre-Coase article, in which he argued that radio-frequency interference represented a detrimental externality that could be reduced by the creation of property rights.", "sample_id": 59}
