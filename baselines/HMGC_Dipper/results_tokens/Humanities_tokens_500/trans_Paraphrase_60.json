{"x": "In the western way of life, the three branches of painting, sculpture and architecture constitute the three classical branches of the visual arts. Art is a wide concept that embraces human activities and their results, the products of which usually express technical skill, beauty, emotion or thought. The interpretation of art has varied considerably in the course of time and in the different countries of the world. Before the seventeenth century, art implied any form of skill and it was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. However, after the seventeenth century, aesthetic criteria were paramount and the fine arts were separated from all other forms of skill, such as the decorative or the applied arts. Theatre, dance, and the other performing arts, literature, music, cinema, and other media such as digital media, are included in the widest definition of the arts. These works are the subject of the specialist disciplines of art criticism and art history. The etymology of the word ‘art’ and its interpretation in the field of philosophy is known as aesthetics. Art and related concepts, such as the creativity of artists and the appreciation of art, are investigated in the field of philosophy known as aesthetics.", "sample_id": 0}
{"x": "Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and Immanuel Kant, among others, have all questioned the meaning of art. But, although this sense has been retained in the English language, the word art has lent itself to a variety of other meanings, all of which are based on the same etymology. At the beginning of the dialogue Ion, Socrates shows no hint of the disapproval of Homer which he displays in the Republic. Socrates in Plato says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational, and, while he approves of it, as well as of the other divine madnesses of intoxication, eroticism, and dreams, in the Phaedrus,2 he wants to abolish the art of Homer and, along with it, the art of laughter. Aristotle, on the other hand, viewed the literary and musical arts as the mimetic or imitative arts, which varied in terms of the imitation of means, object, and manner. Ion3 has Homer in the same position as the Bible is today for Christians, a divinely inspired work which is a source of moral guidance, provided that the interpreter is capable of understanding it.", "sample_id": 1}
{"x": "First of all, the forms of imitation are distinguished by their method: by plot or by characters, by change or by non-change, by drama or without drama. Forms also differ in the subject of their imitation. For example, comedy is the dramatic imitation of men below the mean, tragedy is the dramatic imitation of men above the mean. The special, more recent meaning of art, as a contraction for ‘art’ or ‘fine art’, first appeared at the beginning of the seventeenth century. ‘Fine art’ designates a form of art that serves to express the creativity of the artist, to interest the spectators in the artist’s creative work, and to guide the spectators towards more sublime and finer works of art. According to Aristotle, imitation is the natural act of man, and constitutes one of the advantages of man over the brute beasts. Fine art is a form of art, a set of practices, producing artistic objects which are prompted by an inner necessity (art as a work of art) and which have a message, a symbolic meaning, for the perceiver to decipher (art as an experience). In this latter sense the word art denotes various things: (i) the study of a creative practice, (ii) the process of creative practice, (iii) the product of the creative practice, (iv) the spectator’s experience of the creative work of art.", "sample_id": 2}
{"x": "“In other words, if a skill is used in a utilitarian way, people call it a trade rather than an art. If the skill is used for business or industry, it is called applied art rather than fine art. To scholars like Kant, science and art can be distinguished, in that science is the field of knowledge and art the field of freedom of expression. In this way, science and art may be distinguished; but the field of fine art is often not limited to pure creativity and self-expression. Many people who are interested in art say that the difference between fine art and applied art is one of value judgment rather than of clear definition. On the other hand, some people regard the handicrafts and the decorative arts as fine art. The nature of art is, as the philosopher Richard Wollheim expressed it, “one of the most elusive of all the traditional problems of human culture.” The purpose of art may be to express ideas, as in the case of art whose primary concern is with spiritual, political, or philosophical ideas; to create a feeling of beauty (aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; to give pleasure; to provoke an emotion; or it may be totally obscure. “It has been defined as a vehicle for the expression of emotions and ideas, as an investigation and appreciation of formal properties, and as a mimesis or representation.", "sample_id": 3}
{"x": "The doctrine of form was born with Kant and was developed in the twentieth century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. Leo Tolstoy viewed art as a means of making a passage from one man to another. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood presented an idealist view of art as the expression of the emotions, and consequently the work of art exists as such in the mind of the artist. Larry Shiner spoke of art as something that was made and not something that was made to happen.  George Dickie gave an institutional theory of art, defining the work of art as an object on which the competent authorities of a social group, a so-called art world, have conferred “the status of a candidate for appreciation.” And most recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have explained art as the way a group develops for itself the medium of self-expression and interpretation. Art may be described by such qualities as mimesis, or storytelling, or expression, or emotional communication, or in other ways. In the Romantic era art was regarded as a special mental faculty, like science and religion. But the art we have been accustomed to think of is a European invention of less than two hundred years old. The earliest work of art, a carved shell by homo erectus, is dated by geological investigations at between 430,000 and 540,000 years.", "sample_id": 4}
{"x": "The oldest work of art that has been discovered in Europe is the “giant snails” of the Eifenhofer Cave, a 50,000-year-old work of art by the Neanderthals. Some small drilled shells, 75,000 years old, were found in a South African cave. Containers for pigments dating back 100,000 years have been found. Many great traditions of art have their roots in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Greece, Rome, Olmecs, Incas. There are sculptural works of the Upper Paleolithic, 40,000 years old, and a number of petroglyphs of the same era, but the significance of these is often unclear, since so little is known about the cultures that created them. There are cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs of the Upper Palaeolithic, and of 40,000 years old.", "sample_id": 5}
{"x": "For example, in Greek art, the cult of the human form led to the development of the necessary skills to portray the musculature, the poise, the beauty and the correct proportions. Due to the greatness and duration of these civilizations, more of their art has survived and more of its influence has been transmitted to other civilizations and to later times; in addition, some have provided the first records of the work of artists. The Greek cult of the human form has remained active in small Byzantine works and gradually in Catholic Europe; Renaissance art put great emphasis on the realistic portrayal of the material world and the place of men in it, with a markedly more corporeal human body and the development of a graphical method of perspective that was able to represent depth in a three-dimensional picture space. Nevertheless, the classical realistic tradition survived in small Byzantine works, and in the Catholic countries it was to grow and grow. In the Byzantine and medieval art of the West, many works were devoted to biblical and religious subjects and, in the styles used, the greater splendor of a heavenly world was suggested, such as gold in the background of paintings and gold in mosaics and stained-glass windows, and the human figures were often presented in idealized, flat forms. In the East, too, religion dominated the artistic forms and styles. The rejection of iconography led to an emphasis on geometric patterns, calligraphy and architecture.", "sample_id": 6}
{"x": "There are many different types of painting in China, which can be called the style of the government. For example, Tang Dynasty painting is monochrome and empty, emphasizing a beautiful landscape; Ming Dynasty painting is colorful, messy, emphasizing a variety of scenes; Xian painting is busy and complex, emphasizing a variety of scenes. In addition, there are many other kinds of art, such as bronze figurines, stone carvings, ceramics, terracotta warriors, etc. ; there are also various poems, novels, dramas, etc. In the West, since the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century, the picture of the rational and scientific certainty of the cosmological machine, and the revolutionary dream of abolishing the monarch, was reflected in the works of William Blake's “God's Geometer,”[2] as well as David's revolutionary pictures. Japan, however, named its styles according to the imperial family, and the style of calligraphy and painting were also closely related. After the seventeenth century, the printing industry developed, and woodblock printing was also popularized. Then in the nineteenth century, there were many movements, such as academicism, symbolism, impressionism, and fauvism, etc., and the image of the human emotions and individuality, which was expressed in Goethe's novels, was discarded.", "sample_id": 7}
{"x": "It was at this time that the influence of other cultures on Western art was correspondingly intensified. Hence the boundaries of Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc., cannot be retained for long beyond the period of their birth. In the same way, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the west had an equally powerful influence on the art of the east, with such ideas as Marxism and Postmodernism coming from the west. For example, the Japanese woodcut, which itself was an offshoot of the Renaissance draftsmanship, greatly influenced impressionism and the following development, and the African sculpture was even adopted by Picasso and Matisse. It was this recognition of the unreality of a search for the truth that came to a standstill in the latter half of the twentieth century, and the only result of this was the creation of contemporary art and postmodern criticism, in which all culture and history are seen as changing, mutable forms, which one can appreciate and derive meaning from only with skepticism and irony. In 1970 Theodor Adorno declared:", "sample_id": 8}
{"x": "The artistic work is not a presentation of the thing itself, but rather is what produces the understanding of the public. The German philosopher, Martin Heidegger, in his book, The Origin of the Work of Art, attempts to analyze the essence of art, not only as a manifestation of truth, but as a way of bringing it into being. Art and artistic ideas have been largely diffused through trade. An example is the Silk Road, where Hellenic, Persian, Indian and Chinese influences came together. With the appearance of each new work of art in any culture, the meaning of being changes. Cultures that have met have influenced artistic creation. For example, the multi-ethnic port city of Trieste in the early twentieth century, where James Joyce came into contact with the writers of Central Europe, or the artistic development of New York, a melting pot. The Greek-Buddhist art of the early years of the present millennium is an example of this. Artistic creation is usually divided into special categories, according to a variety of categories that are clearly distinguishable, such as medium, genre, style and form.", "sample_id": 9}
{"x": "There are generally three schools of philosophy of art, according to which art is said to be of form, of content, or of setting. Form includes the manner of the artist and the material composing the work, especially those parts of it that are not figural, i.e., color, contour, tone, space, substance, value, and the principles of design, i.e., balance, rhythm, rhythm, etc. All philosophers deny this, and affirm that the properties of art go beyond material, technique, and form; but unfortunately, it is not possible to agree on a common term for these properties. The extreme formalist, the theory that all the aesthetic properties of art are formal, that is, are constituted by form, has been completely rejected by philosophers. Extreme intentionalism is the doctrine that lays great stress on the intention of the artist, which determines the content of the work of art and reveals its content, its essential and main idea, while all other interpretations are discarded. It defines the subject as the person or idea represented, and the content as the artist's experience of the person or idea represented. Some writers use the terms subject and content, denotation and connotation, others use the terms meaning and significance. The image of Napoleon I on the imperial throne is partly taken from the statue of Zeus at Olympia.", "sample_id": 10}
{"x": "“The system of art, by contrast, is an ever-evolving sphere, which, at the same time, is both socially unhealthy and philosophically unreal. Its restricted interpretation is socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise. Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers usually reject extreme intentionalism because the artist’s intention may be irreducible to intelligibility and therefore of no significance. And then, in some cases, the work’s meaning may be dominated by historical and material conditions, such as the religious and philosophical convictions, the social, political, and economic conditions, or even by the climate and geography. Finally, post-structuralist theory interprets art in the context of its cultural situation, as the thoughts, emotions, and responses of the spectator. Art as a means of expression may indicate a mastered skill or mastery of the means, or it may mean a skillful, perfect, and efficient use of language to express meaning directly or profoundly. Art criticism, like art itself, develops and progresses. There is an understanding with the material that results from handling it and which makes thought easier. Art may be defined as the act of expressing emotions, thoughts, and observations.", "sample_id": 11}
{"x": "The subtle brushwork of John Singer Sargent has been celebrated and deplored, with equal zest, for its virtuosity; at the turn of the twentieth century, at a time when Picasso, whose later artistic career was to make him the most outstanding iconoclast of his time, was completing his own traditional academic training at a time when he mastered it at its highest level. Traditionally, virtuosity has been regarded as inseparable from art and therefore necessary for its success. For Leonardo da Vinci, art was, as much as any of his other pursuits, a manifestation of his skill. In the history of conceptual art, the first work to employ the use of found objects (ready-mades) without any virtuosity, was the Fountain by Marcel Duchamp. The bed by Tracey Emin, and the work of Damien Hirst, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living by Damien Hirst, for example, follow this example, as well as exploiting the mass media. A common contemporary objection to certain kinds of art is the apparent absence of skill in its creation.", "sample_id": 12}
{"x": "For in the case of many conceptual and modern art works the actual production consists in the gathering and grouping of found objects. Hirst’s fame is founded solely on his skill at formulating shocking concepts. The construction of many of his works was delegated to a series of craftsmen. The aim of art has been a multifarious one throughout its history, which makes it difficult to reduce it to any single formula. It is not that the aim of art is in any way vague, but that it has a multiplicity of different, distinctive aims. Yet there are still many modern and contemporary artists who are expert in drawing and painting, and who produce their works by hand. The different aims of art may be divided into those which are non-motivated, and those which are motivated (according to Levi-Strauss). The non-motivated aims of art are those which are intrinsic to being human, those which transcend the individual, and those that are not motivated by any specific goal outside of art itself. Some of these functions of art are indicated in the following chart. Humans’ basic instinct for harmony, balance and rhythm. In this sense art, as the creation of something, is something which humans must by their very nature (no other species creates art), and is consequently beyond utility.", "sample_id": 13}
{"x": "Thus from this gift of nature people developed, by degrees, their particular talents, until their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. The instinct of imitation is part of our nature. Then the instinct for harmony and rhythm; and metre is clearly a measure of rhythm. The experience of the Mysteries is what the arts give us, the experience of our being in the universe; a feeling that we find indescribable. It is the source of all true art and science. Albert Einstein. The expression of the imagination. Jupiter’s eagle, for example, is not, like all the logical (aesthetic) qualities of a thing, the concept of the majesty and sublimity of creation, but rather something else, a suggestion of things similar, which make our imagination fly to more diverse images, innumerable, and so lead to thoughts that words, as such, cannot express. Art provides forms, symbols, and ideas, but not the language of speech or writing, grammatical expressions, but the whole of them in a vague and fluid meaning.", "sample_id": 14}
{"x": "Even though there is no utilitarian (motivated) purpose behind these things, anthropologists know that there is often a purpose at the level of meaning within a culture. The decorative and symbolic functions of art are well known to anthropologists. Immanuel Kant: (The “purposive” functions of art are those functions that require conscious action on the part of the artist or the artist’s subject. ) Most scholars who study rock art and prehistoric objects that cannot be explained by utilitarian principles and that are therefore classified as symbolic, decorative or symbolic, are well aware of the trap that the word “art” sets. This meaning is not provided by a single individual but is often the result of a long process of change over many generations within the culture. Art is, in its simplest form, communication. Art can be used to bring about political change, to comment on some aspect of society, to convey a specific mood, to present a personal psychology, to illustrate some other sphere, to sell something (in the case of commercial art), or to be used for communication. Art as communication usually involves an intention and a goal that is directed toward another person. This is the level of the motivated purpose.", "sample_id": 15}
{"x": "However, the content need not be scientific; emotions, emotions and feelings can be expressed through art. Maps are an example. It may also be used to evoke a specific mood, a certain feeling for the purpose of soothing or entertaining the viewer. Art as a communication medium. Art as a means of political change. This is often the function of artistic industries such as film and gaming. On the other hand, the realism of the positive thinkers from Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France seems clearly to me to be hostile to any progress in the intellect or morals. It was an important role of art in the early twentieth century to make the audience think about the social and political conditions. This is what the movements of Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism and Abstract Expressionism wanted. This is what we mean by avant-garde art. It is the attitude that is currently giving rise to ridiculous books and offensive plays. It is constantly being fed by newspapers and the illiteracy of both science and art by tirelessly satisfying the most mediocre taste; it is clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. I despise it because it is made of mediocrity, hatred and dull arrogance. Art as a \"zone free\" of the action of social censure. - André Breton (Surrealism).", "sample_id": 16}
{"x": "In this case the function of art is used to criticize some aspect of society. Subversive or deconstructive art sometimes asks questions about aspects of society without having any specific political purpose. Art for social investigation, subversion, or anarchy. Art for social causes. Some art, such as graffiti, can be illegal inasmuch as it violates laws (in this case vandalism). Street art and graffiti are usually public images, without official permission, drawn or painted on walls, houses, trains, buses, and bridges, usually on the public side. Some of these images are used to educate the public about things such as pollution. Some artists, such as Marina Debris, use art to bring attention to the problem of pollution. Art for healing or psychotherapy.", "sample_id": 17}
{"x": "For example, the diagnosis drawing series can help to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The resulting work of art may also provide insight into the illness and the proper method of therapy. The healing process is the most important, not the finished work. A similar emotional effect is obtained through the propaganda art which is intended to sell something. Art for propaganda, or commercial art. It has been argued that the human brain far surpasses the capabilities required for survival in the ancestral environment. In both cases, art is employed to lead the viewer to certain emotional and psychological reactions towards a certain object or idea. As seen in Fisher’s runaway selection principle, the peacock’s extravagant tail serves as an attraction for females (see also a runaway selection). The same could be said of human intelligence and the development of human artistic and creative ability.", "sample_id": 18}
{"x": "If art is used for entertainment, it may also be used to sell a product, like a movie or a pc game. The functions of art are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Many of them may overlap. In the first step, the artist imagines his work. Art can be divided into as many steps as can be reasoned, but this article discusses three. The Work Is Divided Art can be divided into as many steps as one can reason about. But the main distinction is the creative process itself, which may be considered to be the main source of artistic inspiration. The preparation of art may also include the discovery of a subject and the research of a subject. By imagining how the work will look, the artist starts the creation of the work. In the second step, the artist actually creates the work. The Black Paintings of Francisco de Goya, who painted them in his old age, are said to have been so dark because of his seclusion and his war experience. They are regarded as a part of the creative process. The biggest hit of the British rock band the Beatles, such as the Revolver album, was influenced by LSD and hashish. He painted them on the walls of his apartment in Spain and probably never showed them to anyone.", "sample_id": 19}
{"x": "According to the specialized journals, the art is regarded as an essential experience. But it is also essential that others can see and value it. One survey found that more than half of visual art students considered reflection an essential stage in the creative process. Of course, art is for beauty, which brings us a wide range of emotions. While many focus on whether the viewer, listener, or reader thinks the art is good or not, art is also a means of transmitting social information and health. From ancient times, many of the best works of art have been made on purpose as a way of showing off wealth and power, often by using a large scale and expensive materials. Many are ordered by the state or the church, and the more modest ones are only available to the most wealthy. Some art is aimed at practical use, and its thoughtful analysis and discussion are intended to be stimulating. In the past, art has been widely available for the ownership of a large part of society, especially in inexpensive and lasting materials such as pottery and metalwork, as well as in fragile materials such as textiles and wood.", "sample_id": 20}
{"x": "The seals were also both artistic and useful and were extensively used by the Ancient Near East's middle classes. After coinage became popular, it too became an art which reached a wide section of the people. Mass-production methods, such as the mold, made possible the distribution of such excellent wares as Roman pottery and Greek figurines, to a wide audience. A great many different kinds of cheap art have adorned homes and public places for centuries. Books were originally quite expensive, but with time they became cheaper and cheaper, so that in the 19th century, even the poor could afford to buy some illustrated books. Another major invention was introduced in the 15th century, when wood-cuts, mostly religious and often very small and hand-colored, were produced. These could be afforded even by the peasants, who glued them to the walls of their huts. The collection in the Kunstmuseum Basel is now known for its broad chronological range, extending from the 15th century to the present day, and is one of the world's most significant museums. The city of Basel opened the first public art museum in the world, the Kunstmuseum Basel, in 1661. The collection consists of pictures and drawings by artists from the upper Rhine area between 1400 and 1600, as well as 19th and 20th century art.", "sample_id": 21}
{"x": "It was true that some parts of the collections of the wealthier classes were open to the public, but for the most part the public was admitted only to those parts of the galleries which were accessible to it. This had been arranged by special arrangements with many royal and private collections placed in galleries, as with the Orleans collection, which occupied one wing of the Palais-Royal in Paris, and which was visited during most of the eighteenth century. The temples of Egypt are a good example, for their richest and most precious decorations are mainly devoted to the parts which are accessible to the public, and to the parts reserved for the priests. The great tour of Italy, which the Renaissance developed into an important industry, depended on the public's access to public monuments. Consequently, the governments and the cities had to make efforts to facilitate the public's visits.", "sample_id": 22}
{"x": "As for the Louvre, when it was opened in 17993 as a public museum of much of the former royal collection of France, it was an important step in the development of public art, as the ownership was transferred to the Republican State, but it was only a continuation of an already established tendency. The establishment of the Prado in Madrid for the public exhibition of parts of the royal collection was completed before the French Revolution, and similar royal art galleries, open to the public, were in existence in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. Most of our modern public museums and art classes in schools can be traced back to this idea of making art available to everyone. The museums of the United States have usually been presented by the very rich for the benefit of the masses. But museums are not only a place where art can be seen but also a place where it can be understood, and this is what research has shown. The Metropolitan Museum in New York, for example, was founded by John Taylor Johnston, the head of a railroad company, who, with his own art collection, started the museum in 1870.", "sample_id": 23}
{"x": "“It is necessary to do more than simply present an object,” declared Joseph Beuys, the great post-war German artist. Artists have attempted to produce art that could not be bought as an investment by the wealthy. Aesthetic innovations that began to emerge in the mid-1960s, and which were ripe by the 1970s, were based on the democratic idea that a work of art is a commodity. In this period performance art, video art, and conceptual art took shape. It was the idea that since the work of art was a performance that left nothing behind, or was an idea, it could not be bought and sold. These ideas have been partly forgotten in the last few decades as the art market has figured out how to sell limited editions of video art, invitations to performances, and the leftovers of conceptual art. The artists broadly classified as “conceptual art” replaced sculptural and painted forms with the idea and the act of publishing, which are free from materiality and from materialistic preoccupations.", "sample_id": 24}
{"x": "Controversies. Art has long been the subject of controversies, that is to say, has been disliked by some of its spectators, for a great variety of reasons. The earlier controversies, however, are often dimly recalled, or have been completely lost to the view of modern times. With the dissemination of the DVD in the early years of the 21st century, artists and galleries, whose income derives from the sale of works of art, have found a new and powerful means of distributing limited editions of digital or digital art to collectors. The criterion of distinction is now understanding the work, not necessarily possessing it, and art is again an upper-class activity. Anicentrism is a general aversion to images, either of any kind or often only religious images, and has been a component of many religions, and a crucial element in the history of Islamic art, where depictions of Mohammed have been particularly controversial. Iconoclasm is the destruction of art which is disliked for any number of reasons, not excluding religious ones. Artistic conventions have often been conservative, and have been regarded with great seriousness by critics, but much less by the general public. The content of images may also give rise to controversies, as with the late medieval paintings of the new motif of the Kiss of the Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus. Much art has been disliked because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties, or other groups.", "sample_id": 25}
{"x": "Théodore Géricault’s Raft of the Medusa,1820, was in part a political commentary on a recent event. Many artists have indulged in scandal-mongering to a greater or lesser extent. In earlier times, when patronage was more the rule than a fashion, the artistic matter of fact had usually been determined by the tastes of the patron, or his own taste, or both; but since the days of Romanticism, when the economic system of art production was altered, the artist’s personal vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the frequency of scandals, though diminishing their significance. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the abandonment of naturalism, the realistic depiction of the external appearance of subjects, produced a conflict that continued for more than a century. E. A. Sargent’s Madame Pierre Gautreau,1884 (Madame X), for example, gave rise to a controversy because of the sexless tint of the model’s earlobe, which was considered indecently suggestive and was said to be ruining the reputation of the lady. In 1863 the scandal was attributed to Édouard Manet’s Luncheon on the Herbe, not to the nudity of the nude but to the fact that the nudity of the model was portrayed in the presence of men dressed in the manner of the age, not in the ancient costume of the past.", "sample_id": 26}
{"x": "Under the Christian religion, a crucifix, the most sacred image, represents the ultimate suffering and death of Christ, and the photo of the crucifix by Andres Serrano was submerged in a jar of his own urinated urine. This outrage led to an admonition in the Senate of the United States against public funding of the arts. The portrait of Leon Golub, Interrogation III, showed a naked female prisoner, hooded, bound to a chair, with her legs open to show her private parts, and surrounded by two persons dressed in ordinary clothes, who surrounded her. The advocate of naturalism of J.M.W. Turner, the British philosopher John Ruskin, saw art as an artificial artifice that carries out the mission of a deep truth, which only nature can convey. Before modernism, in the Western artistic tradition, aesthetics mainly dealt with a more or less correct balance between realism and idealism. And the question of which balance is correct, which has changed throughout the centuries, is almost non-existent in other traditions. Since the 20th century, the definition and evaluation of art have become even more difficult.", "sample_id": 27}
{"x": "Clement Greenberg, in his essay on modern painting, referred to the method of modern art as ‘the specialised procedures of the discipline itself’, which he had originally applied to the abstract expressionists. Greenberg’s original definition was based on the idea that, while realism was a disguise of the medium, using the art to conceal the art, modernism used art to reveal art. The arrival of modernism at the end of the nineteenth century was the first in a series of radical shifts in the understanding of the role of art. A further radical shift occurred in the late twentieth century, with the advent of postmodernism. Having studied Greenberg’s work, there were several important art theorists to follow: Michael Fried, T. J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock, among others. While the limitations inherent in the painting medium, such as the flat surface, the format of the picture plane, the material properties of the paint, were regarded by the old masters as a source of negative power that could only be acknowledged indirectly, by implication or allusion, in modernism they became positive and were openly acknowledged.", "sample_id": 28}
{"x": "Duchamp once said that art was any activity, every activity. Later, the artists of the eighties, nineties and noughties, expanded this technique of self-criticism outside of high art and into the world of popular culture, from fashion, comics, billboards and pornographic images to art in the highest sense. Andy Warhol has distinguished himself by making a special point of including in his work the elements of pop culture and perhaps criticizing them. There is evidence that this is partly true. In his book Inventing Art: A Cultural History, Larry Shiner deals with the development of the modern system of the arts, that is to say the fact that today only certain activities are designated as art. Shiner finds evidence that the previous systems of the arts, before our current system (fine art), recognized art as any human activity that possessed a certain skill; for example, ancient Greek society had not the word art, but techne, which means neither art nor technique, because the distinction between art and technique is a historical creation that came later in the history of humanity. It was used to designate not only painting, sculpture and music, but also cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy and agriculture, etc.", "sample_id": 29}
{"x": "In the West, the three forms of the visual arts are painting, sculpture, and architecture. The definition of art is the subject of debate, and the concept varies greatly from one culture to another. Art is an activity, a production, and the result of creative imagination, characterized by beauty, meaning, and skill. Art as a concept has developed from the Middle Ages until the seventeenth century, when the word was used to include any skill or mastery and was not distinguished from the sciences or the professions. Later, it came to emphasize aesthetic considerations, and a distinction was made between the fine arts and other skills, such as the decorative arts and the applied arts. In the broadest sense, the arts include theater and dance, music, literature, film, and digital media. Artistic works have been created since the beginning of human history, from the first prehistoric art to contemporary art. The concepts of art, creativity, and interpretation are discussed in the philosophical field of aesthetics. The arts are analyzed by art critics and art historians.

{"x": "Every period of the arts was marked by a change in style, and the styles were generally associated with the dynasties. The paintings of the Tang dynasty were mostly of a monotone and simple style, and mainly dealt with landscapes. In Japan, too, the arts have been distinguished by dynasties, and it is remarkable that calligraphy and painting are so intimately allied. The Ming period saw an increase in color and in art, and the story was depicted in the arrangement of the figures. In Europe, in the eighteenth century, the art drew upon naturalistic elements, and some of it exhibited political bias, as for instance in the works of William Blake and Jacques-Louis David. After the seventeenth century, Japanese wood-cuts developed greatly, and this helped to spread art. In the nineteeth century, academic art, symbolism, impressionism and fauvism were all developing, and the art scene was highly complex. After the eighteenth century, the art was, as it were, a reaction against the eighteenth century.", "sample_id": 31}
{"x": "The theory of art as form has its origins in Kant’s philosophy and was developed in the early twentieth century by critics such as Roger Fry and Clive Bell. In the nineteenth century, Leo Tolstoy spoke of art as an indirect means of communication between individuals. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood developed this tendency even further, arguing that art serves to express emotions and that the essence of the work of art is located primarily in the mind of the artist. The American writer and philosopher Lawrence Shiner defined fine art as a form, saying that “it is not an essence, not a destiny, but something we make”, and pointed out that the concept of art, as we understand it today, is a relatively new invention, the result of European history over the last two hundred years. On the basis of Heidegger’s theory, George Dickie defined a work of art as any object that has been recognized as a “candidate for appreciation” by competent individuals who, in the name of the social institution commonly called the “art world”, are designated as such. Art is a history that dates back to the most ancient prehistoric times. A shell engraved by homo erectus, dated between 430,000 and 540,000 years, was one of the first artistic expressions known to us. Art can be characterized by various properties, such as mimesis (representation of reality), storytelling, expression, the communication of feelings, etc. During the Romantic period, art began to be considered a special human faculty, similar to religion and science.", "sample_id": 32}
{"x": "Platon, Aristotle, Socrates, Kant have examined this question of art. The word art has given us several words in English, as 'artefact', 'arteficial', 'artefactual', 'arteficial','medical art','military art', and so on, all of which can be traced to its etymology. In the Phaedo Plato deals with fundamental questions of art. Socrates, for example, claims in the Phaedo that poetry is inspired by the muses and not by rational thinking, and he praises this divine inspiration, with other divine madnesses like drunkenness, lust and dreams. In the dialogue Ion, Socrates does not express the same contempt for Homer that he later shows in the Republic. The Iliad plays a role similar to the Bible in today's Christian society as a divinely inspired book, but one that can only be understood correctly. But in the Republic, Socrates does not agree with the prohibition of Homer's poems and laughs, which shows a complex attitude towards art. In addition, Aristotle also categorized the various types of art, which were all imitation, mimesis, as a result of the difference in the medium, subject matter and methods of imitation.", "sample_id": 33}
{"x": "The oldest known painting in Europe is the Giant Coral of the Einhorn Cave, which dates back to 51,000 years and is attributed to Neanderthals. In a South African cave have been discovered several tiny snail shells with drill holes, dating back some 75,000 years, and also containers for paints dating back 100,000 years. And the first sculptures, such as the Venus of the Kehlstein Cave, and other forms of art such as the Hohle Fels Venus, were discovered in the UNESCO World Heritage Caves and Ice Age Art of the Swabian Alb. But despite the fact that a great deal is known about the culture that produced these works, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the meaning of these works. The artistic traditions of the ancients can be seen in the works of the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Persians, Indians, Chinese, Hellenics, Romans, Olmecs, Incas, Mayas and Olmecs. But the most important artistic development in the world took place in the Swabian Alb between 43,000 and 35,000 years ago.", "sample_id": 34}
{"x": "Greek art developed an intimate knowledge of the human form, by developing methods of representing anatomical proportions and human postures. It was a great influence on other artists, and ancient civilizations have passed on a number of artistic methods to later ages. Contrasting with this, the art of the Byzantine and medieval eras emphasized biblical and religious subjects and was dominated by the use of gold backgrounds in paintings and glass in mosaics and stained glass windows. This period laid the foundations for the next period of art. A transitional period began with the Renaissance, which emphasized the portrayal of material reality and of humankind in it. These works, characterized by an idealized, flat, classical human form, did not lose, however, the influence of the Greek realist tradition in the smaller works of Byzantine art, which re-emerged later in the art of Catholic Europe. In the East, Islamic art was characterized by a lack of figures and a preoccupation with geometric patterns, calligraphy and architectural forms. The development of artistic perspectives, which represent the depth of space and the human figure, was a consequence of this trend, but also continued to emphasize biblical and religious themes, corresponding to the spiritual values of the time.", "sample_id": 35}
{"x": "The more the forms of art vary in their modes of imitation, the more they differ in their nature and in their object. Tragedy, for example, is defined by the imitation of individuals who are inferior to the average, while comedy is defined by the imitation of individuals who are slightly above the average. The concept of art as we understand it today, especially the artistic or fine arts, began to form in the seventeenth century. Aristotle claimed that the capacity for imitation was a feature of human nature and a sign of the superiority of man over the brutes. The word ‘art’ designates a number of connected concepts: the study of a creative skill; the process of developing that creative skill; the creative result. The fine arts as a study embraces a number of disciplines which produce works of art (art as a product) driven by self-expression (art as an activity) and offering a message, a mood, a symbolism which is to be interpreted by the audience (art as an experience). The products resulting from a creative skill; the public’s experience of the creative skill; and the spectator’s own experience of a creative skill. In its ultimate form art aims to stimulate a person’s thoughts, feelings, beliefs or ideas through a stimulation of the senses.", "sample_id": 36}
{"x": "To start with, Heidegger argues that art, not only a means of expressing the truth of a culture, but also a means of producing it, takes the idea that art creates a foundation from which ‘that which is’ is revealed. In his book The Origin of the Work of Art, Martin Heidegger explores the nature of art through a study of ‘being’ and ‘truth’. In ancient times, a work of art often spread through trade routes, changing the meaning of a culture. The work of art, not only representing the truth, but actively creating the truth, changes the meaning of existence for a culture. The interaction between the different worldviews and cultures has a profound influence on the creative power of art. The culture of Hellas, India, China, and Buddhism is an important example of this; Greco-Buddhist art is an important example of the above interaction. The art of a culture can usually be classified into specific forms, genres, media, and styles, often based on distinguishable perceptual characteristics. For example, the port city of Trieste was a multi-ethnic city in Central Europe, and in the early 20th century, many Central European writers, including James Joyce, congregated there; similarly, New York has been recognized as a cultural melting pot that has greatly developed the art. Art, characterized by great variety, can be understood and appreciated only through the distinction of these categories.", "sample_id": 37}
{"x": "The closeness of nations and the increasing intercourse of men led to a general cross-fertilization of ideas, and to a diffusion of the influences of various cultures on Western art. Of these movements, the following can be said: Thermonomical Movement; Fauvism; Cubism; Dadaism; Surrealism; Imagism; Futurism; Dadaism; Cubism; Dadaism; Fauvism; Cubism; Surrealism. Western art has, on its side, had a profound influence on the East in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Thus Japanese prints, influenced by the Renaissance, influenced impressionism and its subsequent developments, and the African sculptures stimulated Pablo Picasso and Matisse. In the second half of the century, the postponement of the idealistic search for truth was effected by the fact that art and the right of art to exist have become an object of suspicion. In 1970 Theodor Adorno had already said: Culture and historical narrations, considered as historical, are treated as mutable and hence open to irony and scepticism. The acceptance of this basic relativism in the present age led to the emergence of postmodern art and criticism.", "sample_id": 38}
{"x": "Philosophy has been sharply critical of the principle of the artist's intention, which is that the artist's intentions are paramount in the understanding of a work of art, and finds this principle to be limiting, as a work of art may contain several meanings at the same time, and the artist's intentions may be either unknown or immaterial. It is often noted that the concept of a God who is beyond time and space, and the artistic creative activity and the human capacity for interpretation, is not excluded from the realm of art and its interpretation. The newer post-structuralist theory places the significance of a work of art in its cultural context, and stresses the ideas, feelings and reactions that it provokes, rather than focusing on the technical methods employed by the artist. It is argued that this interpretation is limiting and “socially unhealthy, philosophically unrealistic and politically naive.” Art criticism is evolving in parallel with the development of artistic practices. Religious and philosophical convictions, the socio-political and economic structure, as well as climate and geography, all can have a significant influence on the interpretation of art. In other cases, historical and material conditions may take precedence. The main function of art is to express emotions, thoughts and observations. The term “art” can refer to a skilled or expert practice or mastery of a form of expression, or to the ability to convey a particular idea, a meaning, with the desired strength or clarity. Often, the mastery of a form of expression is a result of a deep understanding of the material that comes from the experience of working with the material, and this experience in turn influences the thinking and feeling of the artist.", "sample_id": 39}
{"x": "Philosophical views on art generally fall into three categories: formalism, content-analysis and context. Art analysis includes both the means and methods of the artist and the physical composition of his work, the most important of which are non-semantic factors, such as colour, form, dimension, melodic, space, and values. The concept of form is associated with principles of arrangement, such as balance, harmony, proportion, balance, distance, rhythm, and rhythmic organisation. The analysis of art, then, involves a combination of form, content, and context, which allows a more profound understanding of artistic expression and its content. There is no general agreement about the designation of the content of art. Some call it subject, others content, with its implications and associations, meaning, significance.", "sample_id": 40}
{"x": "Rembrandt, now valued for his ephemeral qualities, was mainly valued by his contemporaries for his technical virtuosity. Art has always been considered an essential quality of art, and the very key to its success. In the case of a Leonardo da Vinci, art was a direct expression of skill, a direct extension of the skill he possessed in other fields. On the other hand, Pablo Picasso, who would later become a prominent and influential modern artist, excelled in a classic academic formation. The skill and the technical ability of modern art are a common point of critique in contemporary discussions. At the beginning of the twentieth century, John Singer Sargent's virtuosity was praised and questioned, and Pablo Picasso, who later became an important and influential modern artist, was brilliant in a classic academe. The same is true for Tracey Emin's My Bed and Damien Hirst's The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living. This critique also extends to the media, and explains the use of mass media, and the way of thinking that this challenge to the media raises a challenge to the traditional concept of art. There is a distinction between the famous Marcel Duchamp's Fountain, one of the first examples of conceptual art, which used ready-mades or found objects, but without using the usual art techniques.", "sample_id": 41}
{"x": "From this innate gift, each poet develops his own unique talent, through his improvised inspirations, culminating in the creation of his poetry. Aristotle speaks of harmony and rhythm as a natural inclination of the human soul, which, according to him, is translated into a certain metre. Einstein argues that the most profound experience of all is the feeling of the unknown, and that this feeling is the foundation of all true art and science. Art provides a way of exploring our relationship with the universe. This exploration often occurs spontaneously as one enters into the experience of music or poetry. Thus, the representation of Jupiter’s eagle, if we consider it as a representation of a bird, takes on the sublime, majesty, which in turn arouses a whole host of associations that go far beyond the intellectual understanding of a logical expression. Art gives us the opportunity to express the imagination without the restrictions of a written word, but through images, forms, and symbols. Art embodies all of this, without a sequence of letters, which carry a certain meaning.", "sample_id": 42}
{"x": "Contemporary artists often use found objects to create their work, which has become a sort of hallmark of conceptual art. Damien Hirst, who is celebrated in the art world for his mind-boggling ideas, has outsourced the production of many of his works to other artists and craftsmen. Many contemporary artists still engage in traditional practices, such as painting and drawing, and many create works that require a great deal of handiwork. The aim of art has varied greatly throughout history, and is difficult to define as a single concept. In this respect, art is considered to be a fundamental aspect of human nature, since no other species engages in artistic production. As an anthropologist, Levi-Strauss divides art's aims into two main categories: non-purposeful and purposeful. Non-purposeful aims are those that are part of the human condition, unrelated to the individual's purpose, and which have no external goals. As such, art is motivated by an instinctive desire for harmony, balance and rhythm that is characteristic of humans.", "sample_id": 43}
{"x": "On the surface of things, art is almost entirely useless. But, in reality, it does possess a deep meaning, a significance which has grown up over the centuries, and reflects the culture. In the dances, performances and rituals of certain peoples, it serves as a decoration or a symbol. The artistic purpose is the result of the artistic actions of the creators. Scholars who study rock paintings or prehistoric objects of a useless nature which cannot be explained by any form of daily life are sometimes forced to classify them as decorative, ritualistic or symbolic. Art is essentially a form of communication, and like other forms of communication, it usually carries an intention or a meaning towards a recipient. Hence it is motivated. Art may be used for political ends, to attack social evils, to portray emotions, to describe personal experiences, to illustrate ideas, to sell goods or to serve as a medium of communication.", "sample_id": 44}
{"x": "The diagnostic drawing series is a method of artistic psychotherapy which, unlike conventional clinical methods, is used as a diagnostic tool to study the emotional development of the individual. In the case of the DDS, the purpose is not to produce a finished picture, but to provide the client with a psychologically healing process. The same idea is behind the commercial use of art, which, like propaganda, tries to influence people’s attitudes towards certain things, namely products. These ideas are connected with the Fisherian Runaway and the Principle of the Superiourity of the Handicapped, which suggest that these abilities might have evolved to enhance the chances of reproduction. One explanation for the great capacity of the human brain in relation to the requirements of survival in our environment is that, as with the tail of the peacock, it serves as an indicator of the individual’s fitness for reproduction.", "sample_id": 45}
{"x": "Art not only serves as a vehicle for personal expression, but also enables other people to view and appreciate its value. As art is both a means of self-expression and a medium of communication, it is important to note that art is both a creative and an expressive activity. Indeed, studies have found that a majority of art students see the critical importance of the process of reflection. Such activities are not confined to the individuals concerned. In society at large, art is an indispensable part of the common good, supplying information and helping to improve the quality of life. Although art is often considered to be a commercial success, it is of critical importance, because it also enables us to reflect on our own lives and on the nature of society. It is often said that art is closely associated with wealth and power, as its works are usually large in scale and costly in materials, and have been commissioned by political rulers or religious institutions, while more modest versions are produced for the wealthy. Some art is also designed for a practical purpose, stimulating a dialogue between those who view it and prompting discussions about the meaning of life. But art is not only about individual reflection, it is also about the larger issues of society and the past. It has been available to wider sections of society at various periods in history, and has included pottery, which is a durable medium, as well as more ephemeral works in materials such as textiles and wood.", "sample_id": 46}
{"x": "The institution of the Louvre in 1793, during the French Revolution, marked a great change in the evolution of public access to art, because it passed the ownership of the formerly royal collections to the republic. The construction of the building that now houses the Prado in Madrid was planned in advance of the French Revolution, with the intention of putting some of the royal collections on display, and similarly royal galleries were established in the towns of Vienna and Munich. In establishing the modern public museums and school-based art education programmes, the establishment of art as an access point to all, was a large part of a much wider trend. Museums are not only to provide access to art but also to give it meaning. In the USA, many museums are founded by wealthy individuals who donate their private collections to the public. For example, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded by a railway executive called John Taylor Johnston, who had a personal collection that served as the basis for the museum. Recent studies show that museums play a crucial role in the way people understand and value art in today’s society.", "sample_id": 47}
{"x": "What is more subversive, and whose style is more ‘deconstructive’, is the art of putting colours on public places and the objects which are on them, by the use of spray paints or by means of the stencil. One of the most noticeable examples of such art is graffiti. One of the best-known forms of subversive art is street art, which is created by spraying or using stencils on walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, often without official authorization. Graffiti is a powerful means of raising awareness of a host of social problems. It has been used to highlight such issues as autism, the plight of aboriginal women who have been murdered or have gone missing, the plight of children who are victims of abuse, the war in Darfur, the plight of the victims of the global warming, or to denounce the harmfulness of the consumption of alcohol and tobacco. In addition, street art can be deemed illegal, if it violates laws against vandalism. But art is also recognized as having a therapeutic value, a capacity to ease psychological pain and promote healing. An example of this is the so-called 'trash-fashion', a phenomenon which converts rubbish into fashion, with artists such as Marina de Brist promoting the trend. This type of art is used in therapeutic settings, in order to support the mental health of the patient, to encourage emotional expression and to promote personal growth.", "sample_id": 48}
{"x": "It is the purpose of art to use some of its attributes in order to satisfy its basic requirements. But its fundamental purpose is to express and to evoke something and to reach an emotional response. The functions of art are not mutually exclusive, many overlap, for example, a piece of art made to entertain can also be used for commercial purposes, such as promoting a film or a game. It is at this initial stage that the artist forms an idea of the work and the work itself, and starts the process of making the latter into the former. These stages are the first, the preparation, the execution and the review. The second stage is the actual creation of the art. This stage also includes research into the subject matter and gaining inspiration. The source of inspiration is often the instincts, impressions and emotions of the artist. These include the artist’s mood, environment and even his or her personality. The dark paintings of Goya, for example, were created towards the end of his life and reflected the sadness and sadness that Goya had felt because of the solitude he had lived in and the war he had lived through. Goya painted these directly onto the walls of his home and it is said that he did not discuss these works with anyone. These works are an example of the important role that reflection plays in the creative process, although it is not mentioned directly in the text. Similarly, the members of the Beatles have confirmed that they used LSD and cannabis to create some of their best-known songs, especially those from the album Revolver. The process of creation is a complex one and includes preparation, creation and reflection, all of which affect the end product and the experience of art. Often after the work is completed, the artist examines the work, pondering the impression and the emotions that the work evokes. This can be a source of inspiration for future work.", "sample_id": 49}
{"x": "The public were admitted to some parts of the royal palaces, citadels, and other great houses of the higher classes. The Egyptian temples are remarkable for their great ornamentation, which was for the most part confined to the parts accessible to the public, in contrast to the more sober parts reserved for the priests, which were less accessible to the public. Royal and private collections were sometimes opened to the public. Access to them was sometimes regulated by special dress, which was done, for example, at the Palace of Versailles, where the clientele could rent silver shoe buckles and sabers to meet the required dress. Often these collections were consulted for nothing or for a very small price. The phenomenon of art tourism, mainly on the Grand Tour, grew especially in Italy after the sixteenth century. The States and cities therefore encouraged access to the masterpieces of their art, to enrich the tourist experience. Thus the Orleans collection, for the most part destined for the wing of the Palais Royal, was accessible to the public for a large part of the eighteenth century.", "sample_id": 50}
{"x": "According to Steve Mithen, art is an object or a picture that carries symbolic meaning and acts as a medium of communication. It often aims to produce specific emotions or a mood, in order to relax or amuse the viewer. It is a multiple medium of communication, not only of scientific ideas but also of emotions, moods and feelings. Some of the art of the early twentieth century had a political agenda, for example Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism and Abstract Expressionism, known as the avant-garde, intended to challenge societal norms and stimulate the mind through visual imagery. This purpose is especially manifest in the artistic industries, such as the film industry and the games industry, where the main goal is to amuse and entertain. This view was condemned by the Surrealist André Breton, who regarded it as a source of mediocrity and a hindrance to art and science. It has been argued that such an attitude creates a culture that is a product of mass production, as opposed to the great innovators of the past, such as Thomas Aquinas and Anatole France. They did not want to stifle artistic creativity, because it is a medium that offers a wealth of different perspectives on the world. The so-called free zone in which the artist can freely express their ideas has become a place where the repressing hand of the law cannot be applied.", "sample_id": 51}
{"x": "Coinage, the most important medium of trade in the ancient world, has always been used by the people of all classes to buy their goods. The use of stamps made mass production possible and spread the knick-knacks of the Ancient Romans and the Greeks to a wide audience. Cylinder seals, which were both art and business, were of common use to the emerging middle classes in the ancient world. At first, the price of printed books was high, but they fell steadily and, by the 19th century, they had fallen so much that the poorer people could afford them. In the 15th century, a great innovation was introduced in Europe when woodcutting was begun, and small prints were made, mostly of religious subjects. They were usually small, hand-coloured and cheap, so that even the lowest peasants could adorn their houses with them, glued to the walls. – This new museum was established in Basel in 1661 and its collection, from the first quarter of the 15th century to the present day, is truly overwhelming. The people of all classes have, for centuries, adorned their homes and public buildings with prints of all kinds. But today, with the deafening roar of the motor cars, the one-hundred-year-old collections have come to the fore, and, in spite of the few exhibitions it gives each year, it is ranked among the foremost museums of the world.", "sample_id": 52}
{"x": "I have been interested in the bare truth of things. Many artists in the 1960s and 1970s were determined to make art which went beyond the usual buying and selling of art. As far back as the Renaissance, the aim of the artist has been to make work which resists commodification and thus resists being acquired by the rich as mere adornments. In the 1960s, the idea that art should not be a commodity led to many aesthetic innovations. This period saw the birth of performance art, the art of the happening, the art of performance, and so on. The core idea was that art, as a performance or a thought, could not be commodified. Later, however, these movements’ original intentions have been obscured by the fact that these forms have become commodities. The market has discovered ways to commodify them, and has managed to get round the commodification of performances and happenings by selling the ephemera of them. Those who took part in the conceptual art movement tended to dispense with material form in favour of performance or the production of texts and booklets, seeking to avoid the mere commodification of the art object. But again, despite the best intentions of the artists, the market has found ways of commodifying their work. This is just one more instance of the tension between the artist’s intentions and the workings of the market.", "sample_id": 53}
{"x": "The appearance of DVD recorders in the first years of the century offered artists and galleries a very effective tool for managing the distribution of digital art and other works. Nowadays, in contemporary discussions about art, the standard of authenticity is not the ownership of the work, but the capacity to understand it. It suggests that art appreciation is increasingly considered a very rich activity. Art has been the subject of controversy throughout history, and sometimes provokes strong reactions from the public, for various reasons. Most pre-modern disputes are poorly recorded and are inaccessible to us today. This technology has made it possible to sell a limited edition of a work to collectors, thus enabling the artist to have greater control over his work. However, although public reception of art is variable, artistic conventions are often conservative and doctrinaire, although public reactions may be more diverse. Art has also been accused of taking liberties with certain figures, parties or groups.", "sample_id": 54}
{"x": "In general, the content of formal art has depended more on patrons or commissions than on the artist himself. Since the beginning of the Romantic epoch, however, the artist's will has more and more influenced the artistic production. The gradual and progressive withdrawal of naturalism and realism from the art of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries led to a long and protracted artistic controversy, lasting for almost a century, with the cooperation between the artist and society being strongly expressed. The artists, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, were strongly motivated by the desire for originality and public attention, which often led them to take controversial topics, for example, Théodore Géricault's, John Singer Sargent's, etc.", "sample_id": 55}
{"x": "Gaut and Livingston distinguish two critical theories: intentionalism and formalism. The intentionalists argue that the knowledge of the intention of the author is indispensable for a true interpretation of the work, the formalists deny the significance of the author for a correct interpretation.. It can be interesting to know who created a work of art, but this does not necessarily determine its correct interpretation. The twentieth century saw the emergence of a great debate on the language turn, which is sometimes referred to as the innocent-eye debate within the philosophy of art. Richard Wollheim expressed the view that criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, and that this process is not separated from, but is the work itself. The relationship between language, interpretation and the perception of art has been the subject of debate, and this is where the controversy between intentionalism and formalism has been extended.", "sample_id": 56}
{"x": "Such were the influences in the art of the second half of the twentieth century, whose creators in the years eighties, nineties and noughties developed the idea of self-criticism to a wider range of the visual culture. Among them one could mention such artists as Andy Warhol, who in his works both praised and criticized popular culture and the art world itself. The writer of the book The Invention of Art: A Cultural History, by the way, describes the formation of the modern art system and the delimitation between art and other forms of creativity. It thus poses the question of what criteria certain activities are designated as art today, and reveals the socially determined nature of such designations. The theoretical basis of pop art could be traced back to the thought of Marcel Duchamp, who insisted that all activities were art. The concept of art is therefore regarded as an historical invention arising at a later stage in human history. It was claimed that in the ancient Greek civilization there was no word for art, but the word technique, which included all kinds of skill, painting, sculpture, music, but also cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and farming. In the midst of the complex game between the pop art and the further development, there was, in the end, a further discussion on the relationship between the concept of art and cultural criticism.", "sample_id": 57}
{"x": "Whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist have any effect on the criticism and appreciation of his work is the question which is the subject of the fallacy. The emergence of the New School of criticism led to considerable debates about this fallacy. Wimsatt and Beardsley argued that the intentions of the author were irrelevant to the text, and that the literary critic should cite only the internal meaning of the text, without the “external meaning” of the intentions of the author, which were usually misleading and unimportant. In their article on the intentional fallacy, published in the issue of October–December 1946, Wimsatt and Beardsley expressed their view that the intention of the author, the ‘intended meaning’, was a “fallacy of construction”. In later years, the critics of the reader-response theory attacked this opinion. At the same time as their article on the intentional fallacy, Wimsatt and Beardsley also wrote another article, on the “affective fallacy”,1 dealing with the use of the personal and emotional reactions of the reader as an aspect of literary analysis, and arguing that such reactions were not valid means of evaluating the text. On the basis of these two fallacies, the debate about the ongoing conflict between the intentions of the author, textual analysis and reader interpretation, has had a lasting influence on the theory of literature and criticism. It is notable that Stanley Fish, a prominent figure in this theory, who began his career in the New School of criticism, attacked Wimsatt and Beardsley in an article entitled ‘Literature in the Reader’,2 published in 1970.", "sample_id": 58}
{"x": "The role of language, and more particularly of rhetorical figures, in art history and the discourse of history has been investigated by Hayden White. The linguistic turn in the humanities and in art history was profoundly influenced by the structuralist thought of Ferdinand de Saussure and the poststructuralist thinking of Jacques Derrida. In the early 80s, the artist Mark Tansey produced a notable work of art titled The Lamentation of Death. During the 1960s and 70s, scholars such as Ernst Gombrich and the philosopher and semiotician, with the help of his book, The Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols, [26] maintained that the conception of a work of art precedes the experience of it, and that this has had long-term consequences for the study of art and its interpretation in the context of the humanities. This emphasises the fact that language is not merely a transparent medium for expressing thought, a point that was also made by the philosophers Johann Georg Hamann and Wilhelm von Humboldt.", "sample_id": 59}
