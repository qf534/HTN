{"x": "It is generally defined as the area of social life that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources. The economy is the field of production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. In this way, the economic sphere is a social sphere, the result of human practices and activities, and not independent. These factors give it context, content, and establish the conditions and the limits within which the economy works. Production is the principal driving force of the economy, which makes use of the natural resources, labor, and capital. Economic relations occur when two parties or groups of people establish the value or price of the goods and services exchanged, usually expressed in some currency, but such monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic field. And the nature of the economy has changed with time, in response to technological developments, innovations in products, services, and processes, changes in the distribution of markets (for example, the introduction of universal education has led to the elimination of child labor in some regions), and changes in industrial relations.", "sample_id": 0}
{"x": "The more familiar sense, of the domestic economy of a country or locality, does not seem to have come into general use before 1650. The Latin term is derived from the Greek oikonomia or oikonomos; the first element oikos means house, the second nemein means 'to manage'. The Babylonians and their neighbours in the city-states developed a form of economy similar to the present-day notion of the economy of a state or country. History As long as people have produced, distributed and shared goods and services there has been some kind of economy; economies have grown larger as societies have grown larger and more complex. Old economies were based on subsistence farming; and the Shekel was the first unit of weight and currency used by the Semitic peoples. Babylon and its neighbours developed the first known system of administration, with courts, prisons and official records. In Mesopotamia around 3000 BC the term oikonomia came into use.", "sample_id": 1}
{"x": "The greater part of the exchange of goods took place through relations. Traders also bartered on the public markets. A barley-shekel was at first both a unit of account and a unit of weight, as the English pound is originally the measure of a pound of silver. The economic discussion was directed by scarcity. In the history of Chinese economics, the enormous cycle of the institutional innovations contains an idea. In ancient Greece, whence the English word economy derives, many people were slaves of the landowners. In the Middle Ages, what we now call economy was still close to subsistence. Most of the exchange took place between relations. The land-tenure in a non-market economy is a hereditary property, guaranteed by law and protected from bureaucratic exploitation. The great conquerors had in addition to raise what we now call venture capital (ventura, ital. risk) to finance their conquests. The first businesses were trading houses. The first stock-exchange was established in Antwerp in 1513. The discoveries of Marco Polo (1254-1324), Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) and Vasco da Gama (1469-1524) led to the first world economy. The European conquests were the branches of the European states, the so-called colonies. Economy at that time meant chiefly trade.", "sample_id": 2}
{"x": "The increasing secularization of Europe permitted the states to use the immense wealth of the Church to develop the cities. France, Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic sought to control trade by way of import duties, and mercantilism (from mercator, the Latin word for merchant) was the first attempt at combining private wealth with public interest. Wealthy bankers, such as Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1774–1857), began to finance the government’s wars and its public works. The first secretaries of state for finance came into being. The aristocracy began to lose its hold. The Industrial Revolution was underway. The first economist in the true modern sense of the word was the Scotsman Adam Smith (1723–1790), who was inspired partly by the ideas of physiocracy, a reaction against mercantilism, and partly by Adam Marré, a later student of economics. He defined the elements of national economy: products were offered at their natural price, which was determined by competition—the laws of supply and demand—and the division of labor. From then on, “economy” meant “national economy,” that is, the activities of the citizens of a particular nation. Malthus (1766–1834) applied the concept of supply and demand to the question of overpopulation. The so-called interest hypothesis was to serve as the foundation for economics.", "sample_id": 3}
{"x": "This period is called the Industrial Revolution because the organization of production, division of labour and division of labour allowed the mass production of goods. In Europe the system of mercantilism (today known as protectionism) was replaced by wild capitalism, which brought with it an increase in the volume of production. The beginning of the Industrial Revolution was a turning point in human history. It affected almost every aspect of daily life in some way. The twentieth century After the chaos of two world wars and the terrible Great Depression, politicians began to search for new ways of regulating the economy, which Friedrich August von Hayek (1899-1992) and Milton Friedman (1912-2006), the apologists of a free market and the fathers of neoliberalism, sought to introduce. The current notion of the economy did not become widely known before the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s. The state can eliminate the economic crisis and encourage growth through macroeconomic intervention, is the so-called theory of Keynesianism, in honor of the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946).

Some believe the term was coined by Daniel Bell in his book The Coming of Post-Industrial Society in 1973, while others attribute it to social theorist Ivan Illich in his book Tools for Conviviality in 1970. It has also been used in philosophy to describe the decline of post-modernism at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. The idea of post-industrial society became increasingly important after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transition of the Eastern Bloc countries towards democracy and market economies. In particular, with the development of the Internet as a mass medium and communications channel after 2000, a new idea emerged—the idea of the information economy, with e-commerce and electronic businesses becoming more important.

{"x": "ELEMENTS AND CLASSES A MARKET ECONOMY consists of a network of participants, whereby goods and services are produced, according to the demand and supply of participants, and are exchanged for barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currency; a planned economy is one whereby government directly controls the production and distribution of goods and services; a green economy is a low-carbon and resource-efficient one. A gig economy is one where the participants work on a short-term assignment, assigned on demand. The global economy is the world economy. Depending on the precedence, the economy can be said to have developed in the following periods or degrees of precedence: ancient economy was largely based on farming, in the last three centuries the importance of farming was reduced to the industrial form of agriculture.

The more usual economic analysis of a country is based on indicators such as GDP and GNP per capita, which although useful are only those whose result in money. There is now a range of subjects that examine the economy, centred around the social science of economics, but including sociology, history, anthropology and geography. In an older, less frequently used terminology, one can distinguish between the indicators of the economy expressed in real terms, such as GDP or in nominal terms, which are not corrected for the rate of inflation. The study of economics is roughly divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics. The macroeconomic study is usually concerned with the national or regional economy and common subjects of study include income, production, money, prices, employment, trade, and others.

The term is also used to describe the long-term development of the American economy, which was transformed from a classical manufacturing-based economy into a service-based economy, and was driven by new technology and innovation. The new economy traces its origins back to a Time article from the year before in which the transition from heavy industry to a new economy based on technology was described. By 1997 Newsweek was mentioning the new economy in many of its articles. During the period from 1972 to 1995, growth in labour productivity, measured by the amount of work done per hour, had averaged 0.94 per cent per year; but in the mid-nineties the rate of increase picked up: between 1995 and 1999 it averaged 2.65 per cent. From around 1995 US growth also started to accelerate, partly due to higher productivity growth. The economist Robert J.

{"x": "In econometrics, an abstract economy is a concept introduced by Gérard Debreu in 1952. In game theory, the abstract economy (also called the generalized N-person game) is a model that generalizes both the standard model of an exchange economy in microeconomics and the standard model of a game in game theory. An equilibrium in an abstract economy generalizes a Walrasian equilibrium in microeconomics and a Nash equilibrium in game theory. Moreover, both theorems have been extended to irrational agents—i.e., to agents whose preferences are not transitive and incomplete. Hence, Shafer and Sonneschein proved the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium in the Arrow–Debreu model. In the context of Debreu, an abstract economy is a finite set of agents. For each agent i  N, there is: A set of actions X i  R l, called the global set of the actions of the agent. Each agent can have any set of actions. The set X j i is the set of all possible actions of the agent. X j i is defined by the Cartesian product of all the action sets:", "sample_id": 15}

An alternative to the above, which does not depend on the continuity of the graphs, is that the utility functions U i, i = 1, 2,..., N are quasi-concave with respect to x i, x i, and upper-half-continuous with respect to x. The function W i (x i) =max x i U i (x i, x  i) is continuous. The proofs rely on the Kakutani fixed point theorem. A set Y i (a subset of R l mathbb R l ) represents the consumption set of the consumer i. Suppose w i  R l is a random assignment to the consumer i.", "sample_id": 17}

We can say inductively that the player chooses the price in a way that equals the difference between supply and demand: if the right-hand term of U N (y,p) is negative, then the player chooses a low price, whereas if the left-hand one is positive, then the player chooses a high price. The utility functions V i, V i, are continuous and almost concave.", "sample_id": 19}
{"x": "In a nutshell, this is to assume that all agents are unsatisfied. The definition Ai(y,p)=yiyi  pwiywi,pwiywi, pwiywi, for example, guarantees that the sum of the expenditure of any agent will not exceed the limit of the budget. The definition Ui=Vi guarantees that each agent's consumption is equal to the uti-max of his budget. The assumption that viyi=yiyi was made in the proof, but this assumption is not necessary: the proof is valid even if the utility of other agents depends on consumption (externalities) or on prices. The definition U N (y,p)=p(yiwi) guarantees that total consumption is equal to total wealth. Consequently, if the market economy satisfies the above three conditions, then there is a competitive equilibrium. In the generalized model of Shafer and Sondsenschein, we assume that the production is irreversible. In the abstract economy with preferences, it is assumed that the price of any production satisfies all the preferences of all the consumers.", "sample_id": 20}

Notice that the preference relation is neither complete nor transitive. The theory of exchange as a special case of the generality of definition. The price p and the allocation y of a competitive equilibrium in such a trading economy are given by a price vector p and a distribution y with the following properties: the sum of all prices is one; the sum of all distributions y i is at most the sum of the initial wealth w i; for each i:", "sample_id": 22}
{"x": "By this criterion the existence of a competitive equilibrium in the generalized exchange economy can be shown to depend on the following conditions: Every  i (equivalently, every P i) is relatively open (or equivalently, every P i has an open graph); For every bundle x, every set P i (x) is convex and not the same as x (irrelevance); Mas-Collel added the condition that every set P i (x) is not empty (= not saturated). The market-maker reduction outlined above, from the exchange economy of Arrow and Debreu to the abstract economy of Debreu, can also be performed from the generalized exchange economy of Mas-Collel to the generalized abstract economy of Shafer-Sunshinel. A negative example The following example shows that if the open-graph property is not satisfied, there can be no equilibrium. There is an economy with two goods, a and b.

Now, there are two cases. If the price of bananas is zero, then both agents can afford to purchase (1,2), which is strictly better than their allocations. This means that the allocations of both agents must be (1,1). In both cases the price is not a balance. If the price of bananas is some positive p > 0 (where a i is the price of apples) then both agents can afford to buy (1+p, 0) which is strictly better than their allocations. This cannot be a balance. Let us now take a few more basic assumptions: Each agent’s budget is nonempty, convex, closed and lower-bounded. The preference relation is nonempty: P i (y i)   (that is, P i (y i )  ). The cost function of the agents is nonempty: P i (y i )   (that is, P i (y i )  ) (this is the non-saturation condition).", "sample_id": 24}

{"x": "According to Matthew J. B. Crawford, “Attention is a resource, and everyone has only so much of it,” and Thomas H. Davenport and John C. Beck add to this definition: “Attention is the focused engagement of the mind on a specific information item.” Attention economics is an approach to information management which treats human attention as a scarce commodity and applies economic theory to a variety of information problems. Attention enables us to filter information in such a way that we are able to extract the most important information from the environment and to ignore irrelevant details. One of the main consequences of this is that our mental capacity is limited and our ability to perceive information is also limited. When something enters our awareness, we pay attention to it and then we decide whether to act on it. These filters are implemented, for example, in the so-called recommendation systems which try to display the most relevant, most interesting and most individualized information based on the previous history of the searches. Whether they take attention economics into account consciously or unconsciously, all applications rely on the possibility that if something is not found in a short time the person will find it in some other way.", "sample_id": 26}
{"x": "According to recent theory, from a wide range of disciplines—psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and economics—we have a limited amount of mental resources available at any given time, and that when we allocate them to one task, the resources available for other tasks will be reduced. Because attention is a mental process that involves the selective concentration of mental resources on a single piece of information to the exclusion of other information, attention can be seen as a limited mental resource. By drawing on these ideas, Erik Brynjolfsson, Seon-Tae Kim, and Joo-Hee Oh show that this makes it possible to formalize a formal analysis of the economy of attention and to establish a value for the free goods that come with it. In a world where information is abundant, a dearth of something else follows, a dearth of the very thing that the information consumes, and that is the attention of its recipients. This dearth, or rather poverty, of attention follows from a wealth of information and gives rise to the need to divide up the scarce attention resource between the numerous sources of information which would consume it. The concept of the economy of attention has its origins in a paper written in 1971 by the economist and psychologist Herbert A. Simon, who writes:", "sample_id": 27}

{"x": "Expediting these connections too much, it may lead to “social interaction overload,” that is, a state in which people are overloaded with the management of their relationships with others, as for example, in the context of social network services where people are subject to a high level of social solicitations. Specifically, attention to relationships can be considered as long-term attention. Social attention can be linked to collective attention, that is, collective attention that is paid to something or someone. With the development of digital media and the Internet, the distribution of attention has become easier, and everyone has the opportunity to become a content producer or an attention commenter. As a practical application, “Attention economics” in advertising considers the attention of potential consumers as a resource. The traditional model of the advertising industry regarded the purchase of attention as a linear process that began with AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action).

As soon as man engaged in the production, supply and distribution of goods and services, he invented the economy. The Babylonians, first in setting up a juridical and administrative system, with courts, prisons and records, introduced debts, contracts and commercial practices, concepts of private property. Then, by way of foundation, the economic practices of the cities of Babylon and their surroundings, very similar to those of today, began to be organized.

Individuals, companies, organizations, governments, these are the economic agents that operate. Production is the main source of economic activity, it makes use of the elements of nature, labor and capital. Economic transactions take place when two or more parties agree on the price of a good or service, generally expressed in a particular currency, but they are only a small part of the whole. In time, the evolution of the economy has been linked to technological progress and innovation, which have given birth to new products, services and practices, and a diversification of the market, as well as to changes in labor relations, for example the transition from child labor to universal education.", "sample_id": 31}

This change is one of the most notable events in the history of mankind, and has affected the most intimate relations of man. In the midst of two World Wars and the Great Depression, the Statesmen sought for new methods of managing the business of the world.

The whole policy of the State is nothing but a kind of mercantile state. In 1790, the Scottish Adam Smith was called the first economist. Smith, influenced by physiocracy, a reaction to mercantilism, laid the foundations of a national economy. The Industrial Revolution made a decisive turn in economic thought. Malthus developed the notion of the equilibrium of the market in the question of overpopulation. Smith laid down the principle that free trade is the most important motive of mankind, which is still one of the foundations of economics. He put forward the idea that the product is offered at the natural price, determined by competition, by the supply and demand of the market and by the division of labor. Malthus deepened the understanding of the economy of the growth of population and the resources of the country.", "sample_id": 34}

The word shekel was the historic name of the monetary unit, and also the weight unit, as the English pound originally was. During the Middle Ages, the trade was mostly restricted to the production of daily bread, which was largely carried on between the different classes of society. The discussions of that time were largely influenced by the concept of scarcity. The Chinese economic laws introduced the idea that a non-market economy could introduce an institutional innovation and thus protect the firms from bureaucratic exploitation. But the world economy developed more and more, thanks to the discoveries of Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and other explorers. The great conquerors were particularly able to borrow what is now called venture capital, from the Italian ventura, which means venture, and which could expect to be paid back by the products of the newly discovered areas. In this time the term economy was primarily associated with trade. The first businesses were trading houses, and in 1513 the first stock exchange was established in Antwerp.", "sample_id": 35}
{"x": "The collapse of the Iron Curtain, and the Eastern Block’s subsequent transition to democracy and the market economy, rekindled interest in the concept of the post-industrial society. In many countries the resulting economic system is known as social market economy. It combines a capitalist market economy with various social policies aimed at establishing a level playing field for everyone. In 1958, economist John Kenneth Galbraith published his influential work Affluent Society. It dealt with the problem of how to classify the societies of the West. But it was not until the Internet became a major communications and mass media tool, particularly after the year 2000, that the landscape of the global economy was transformed yet again. The development of e-commerce and e-business created a global information society, in which interconnectedness and digital communications and information sharing have become increasingly important. Some commentators believe the term post-industrial society was first used by Daniel Bell in his book The Coming of Post-Industrial Society in 1973.", "sample_id": 36}
{"x": "Supply and demand determine the market economy; individuals or companies who, as economic agents, exchange goods and services, for money or barter, according to their respective needs. Depending on their structural and administrative characteristics, economic systems can be classified into various types. Planning is an economic system in which the government or its political agents control the production, distribution and price of goods and services, and where a predetermined plan determines the distribution of resources, not a market economy. In the market economy, prices are determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers. A \"ghost economy\" is a term that refers to the short-term, ad hoc and often digitally mediated jobs of the moment. The green economy focuses on low emissions and resource efficiency. It relies on public and private investment to reduce pollution, improve energy efficiency, preserve the biosphere and preserve the functioning of the functioning of the eco-systems. The world economy consists of the economic systems of all countries on earth, reflects the common economic activity and interdependence of the individual nations. Workers in this economy are usually involved in short-term projects rather than in the long-term employment relationship. The development of economic systems can be understood in various historical phases. It includes all economic activity that is not regulated or taxed by the state, from street trade to unregistered companies. In the old economy, people had to go to the fields to work and to eat, and they produced only as much as they needed.", "sample_id": 37}
{"x": "Modern economists, policy makers, and other persons of note often refer to the “real economy,” that is, to that part of the economy which produces goods and services. While these indicators can give useful information, it must be noted that they cover only those activities which are involved in monetary transactions. This distinction is crucial in order to compare the real economy with the paper economy. Measurements of economic activity can be divided into two main groups: real values, which are adjusted for inflation (e.g., real GDP), and nominal values, which are not. Also, although the main focus is on economics as a social science, related disciplines such as sociology, history, anthropology, and geography help to clarify economic phenomena. The field of economics is usually divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macreconomics is typically studied at the regional and national level, with macroeconomic indicators covering such things as national income, national income per capita, and the money supply.", "sample_id": 38}
{"x": "After a long period of stagnation from 1972, the United States experienced a considerable upswing from 1995. The concept of the “new economy” was first publicized in an article in The Economist in the spring of 1983, and it acquired a special meaning in the euphoria of the late nineties, when the economy grew rapidly, inflation was low, employment was high, and when many forecasts were made and, at times, some were too optimistic. From 1972 to 1995, the average growth rate of productivity per hour of work was approximately one percent per year. But from 1995 to 1999, productivity grew by a much higher rate of 2.65 percent per year. The increase in productivity mainly caused the upswing. Meanwhile, employment rose and inflation fell. The new economy is still a subject of debate and interest for economists and politicians because it is still determining the future of the economy, especially the future of the American economy, but also outside it. The economist Robert J. Gordon has written about the new economy and its background, about the development and the factors that have influenced it.", "sample_id": 39}

The main benefits accrue to those industries in which the products of computing technology are made, namely the manufacture of personal computers, office machinery and durable consumer goods, which are in turn, a small proportion of the total. It is the latter group which are the beneficiaries of the current ‘new economy’. According to the theory of Kondratiev waves,2 which suggests that economic growth occurs in long cycles, lasting between 50 and 60 years, the present phase of growth, usually referred to as the ‘new economy’, is part of a new Kondratiev wave, expected to end in the 2040s. This phase is characterized by technological innovations in a number of fields, including the Internet, telematics, bionics and other biologically based life sciences. The period is also characterized by the development of a whole new set of financial instruments, such as stock options. The term ‘dotcom’ is commonly used to refer to the boom in Internet companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This period is often associated with the rise and fall of a dot-com bubble, in which companies which have an Internet-based product or service enjoyed rapid growth in value, compared to stocks in more established industries.

{"x": "Man, Economy, and State is a foundational work of Austrian economics. Its author, Murray Rothbard, was an economist and political theorist. The text is divided into several sections, each of which addresses a different aspect of economic theory. Among the topics treated are the functioning of the market, the meaning of prices, and the role of capital. Rothbard begins with a description of the nature of human action, which he defines as a purposeful behavior aimed at achieving a certain goal. He argues that economics is fundamentally based on the notion of individual choice. He also discusses the effects of government intervention on the economy, arguing that it leads to the creation of inefficiencies and unforeseen consequences. He highlights the importance of private property and voluntary exchange in the economic system. 2 Man, Economy, and State remains an important work in economic literature, shedding light on the principles of human action and market dynamics. It has influenced the development of libertarian economic thought and has attracted the attention of both supporters and critics. It is often cited as a fundamental work of the Austrian school of economics. Its arguments are still relevant to today’s debates on economic policy and the role of the state in the economy.", "sample_id": 41}
{"x": "Some prominent economists, like Joseph Stiglitz and Blake Belding, are opposed to massive investments in the field of information technology, especially in software and underutilized fiber-optic cables. This school of thought holds that innovations in hardware and software can radically change the future economy, and information will become the dominant asset in this new era. Their concern is that some of these investments may fail to produce the anticipated return. Yet the data show that investment in information technology has been strong in the United States since at least 2002. In the end, while we can't tell yet what the effect of this investment on productivity growth will be, it's certain that the relationship between the investment in information technology and productivity is complex and complex. The year 2001 was a setback for some of the predictions made in the heat of the economic boom. And economist Robert Gourdain's suggestion that the contribution of information technology to productivity was overstated was backed up by later studies that confirm that heavy investment in the field of information technology has indeed had a positive effect on productivity growth.

The equilibrium of an abstract economy is the equilibrium of microeconomics and the equilibrium of game theory. It was introduced by Gerard Debreu in 1952, who then called it the generalized game of n people and demonstrated the existence of equilibrium in it. Later, the economists Shafer and Sunnunchexiion1 developed the notion of the abstract economy, and this in turn was confirmed by Arrow and Debreu by proving the existence of the Walrasian equilibrium, also known as the competitive equilibrium, in the Arrow-Debreu model. In the model introduced by Debreu, the abstract economy consists of a finite number n of agents.

{"x": "The goal of a market participant is to choose the price that equals supply and demand. The player’s utility function is: U_N(y, p)= p.sum.y-sum.w_i, where y represents the quantities of goods consumed, p.sum.y–sum.w_i represents the quantities of goods owned, and w.sum.p represents the quantities of goods each player possesses. If an economy is to achieve equilibrium, certain conditions must be met. When the supply of a commodity exceeds its demand, the right-hand side of the utility function U_N(y, p) becomes negative, and the player chooses a lower price; and if demand exceeds supply, the term is positive, and the player chooses a higher price. These conditions assure that the abstract economy conforms to the principle of equilibrium.

A market economy is represented by a system of N-1 consumers and l homogeneous, divisible goods. For each consumer i the following components are distinguished: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

{"x": "The assumption that all the agents are not satiated, makes it possible to define for each of them an option set which is expressed by the notation Ai (y, p) = y i  Yi p w i . This ensures that the total expenditure of each agent is not exceeded by his budget. Also, the notation UN (y, p) = p   (sum Yi - sum w i) ensures that the total consumption is equal to the total initial endowment. Finally, the utility function Ui = Vi shows that each agent's consumption is minimized so as to achieve maximum utility within the budgetary limits. So if an economy meets these three conditions, it is in equilibrium. In Shafer and Sodenschein's generalized model, the elements that can be identified in each agent i are: - a choice set Xi (y, p) as we have seen. It is important to note that although the above proof assumes that the utility function is defined by the consumption y i, this assumption is not necessary, and the proof remains sound if the utility depends on external or price influences. - a budget constraint Ai (y, p) which ensures that the total consumption is equal to the total initial endowment.", "sample_id": 49}

The satisfaction of this condition is denoted by a utility function, U_i, X  R. For the existence of an equilibrium, there are certain sufficient conditions. For each person i, there is no other choice x_i', such that: U_i (x_i, x_)  U_i (x_i, x_).

{"x": "According to Matthew Crawford, “The human attention is a resource, and a person only has a certain amount of it.” Attention economics is a theory of the economics of attention, which holds that the human attention is a limited resource, and applies economic principles to the study of information. A key aspect of attention economics is that it recognizes the limitations of human cognition. Attention is a process of deliberately focusing one's mental power on a specific piece of information, and is the basis for the action of the individual. That is to say, the person filters the information, extracts the most important ones from the environment, and ignores the rest. According to the theory of attention economics, people can only process a certain amount of information at the same time. In practical terms, there is a concept of attention economics in the study of the design of the interface of the computer. To make the information on the screen more convenient for people to use, the designer can make the information displayed more suitable for people's interests, according to their preferences and interests. Based on the observation that people are more inclined to use other applications if they can't find the information they want quickly, the filter is made more personal. In order to make the information on the screen more convenient for people to use, the type of information that the filter makes is based on the interests and preferences of the users, and a large amount of information can be ignored.", "sample_id": 53}

This is because if an agent is willing to accept bundle y it is essential that he be able to afford it. In a word, the principles of Pareto improvement and compensated equilibrium are necessary for the study of the preferences of the agents and the economy. Pareto-optimized distribution is an allocation of resources in which it is not possible to make further improvements without worsening at least one of the agents; a Pareto improvement is an allocation in which an alternative allocation y' for a certain number J of the agents is better than the current allocation for all other agents; it is expressed formally as:", "sample_id": 54}
{"x": "Some economists propose that monetary exchange may be replaced by the economy of attention. Since the mid-1990s, the idea that Simon had raised about information overload being an economic problem has resurfaced in the analysis of the consumption of information. Several authors, mainly influential ones such as Thomas H. Davenport and Michael Goldhaber, have introduced the notions of the economy of attention and the economy of attention to describe the phenomenon. Editor of the science of digital culture, Kevin Kelly, has noted that, as of 2008, the attention economy increasingly consists of consumer products whose reproduction cost is very low. These definitions seek to address the challenges that the economy of attention poses for consumers and producers. The producers, faced with this new competition, must seek to make their products more attractive by adding valuable intangibles which they can not reproduce, which increases their value.", "sample_id": 55}
{"x": "This reduction shows that certain conditions are sufficient for the existence of the competitive equilibrium in the generalized market economy: (1) the cost of a transaction is zero; (2) if a price is taken to be constant, it is necessary that this is so; (3) there is no adverse demand for the good in question; and (4) that the cost of an extra unit of exchange is not less than the cost of a unit of consumption. The market-maker reduction described here leads us from the Arrow-Debreu market economy to Debreu's abstract economy, and it is equally applicable to the generalized market economy of Mas-Colell and the generalized abstract economy of Shafer-Sunnienschein. For any set x, the set P_i(x) is convex and does not contain x itself, showing irreflexivity. Every preference relation prec_i is relatively open, which is equivalent to saying that every preference order P_i has an open network. 3. Mas-Colell added an extra condition: that P_i(x) be non-empty. This showed that P_i is not saturated. Here, if we do not have the open network, the existence of the equilibrium can fail, and we shall illustrate this by assuming that there are two agents, w_i and w_j, who can each prefer any of the two good-pairs x_i to any other. That is, w_i is a factor of x_i, which means that it is in the interior of the respective choice sets.", "sample_id": 56}
{"x": "And in the meantime, the rise of digital media and the Internet has changed the whole situation, giving new possibilities for dividing our attention. The latter relates to the persistence of our attention on our social contacts. An excess of attention on them will result in “social interaction overload”, the resentment that a person has of the social solicitations sent to him, and this will lead to a psychological overload, which will eventually lead to an inability to establish and maintain relationships. This has also led to the notion of “collective attention”, which shows how attention to something new is distributed over a large population and fades out. In the field of advertising, the notion of “attention economics” is based on the fact that consumers' attention is a valuable commodity. People can now reach a large audience by creating their own content and sharing it, as well as consuming the content of others. This is called “the phenomenon of attention economies”. The classic media has its own concept of a linear process of consumer attention.", "sample_id": 57}
{"x": "Let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there is an equilibrium. In economics, this relation is completely transitive, but does not possess an open graph, and hence there is no equilibrium. There are two solutions to this problem. First, in this situation, the allotment of each agent is at least lexicographically (1,1), which means that the allocation of both agents is exactly (1,1) . Second, if the price of the bananas is p and the price of the apples is 1, then both agents can also afford the bundle (1 + p, 0). So if the price of bananas is zero, both agents can afford the bundle (1,2), which is clearly more profitable than the existing allocation (1,1). This bundle is also clearly more profitable than the allocation (1,1). In both cases, the proposed price cannot be an equilibrium price. The economic result of Fon and Otani is to generalize the optimality theorems to a generalized exchange relation of Mas-Colell's. In order to do this, they make the following basic assumptions.", "sample_id": 58}
{"x": "This situation is often referred to as “information overload”. People may be more inclined to search and compare, expecting to gain greater benefits than costs. Since advertising costs have greatly declined, especially on the Internet, the possibility of flooding consumers with so many advertisements that they can no longer easily cope with them has appeared. One way to consider such information as a harmful externality, like a type of pollution, is to see it as the effect of advertising or spam. People have expressed concern about advertisements that draw people's attention, and this attention is not a direct benefit to consumers, so the problem is referred to as “theft of attention”. Using the market as a method of dealing with externalities is a solution advocated by the economist Coase in “The Problem of Social Cost”[9]. For example, air and water pollution are externalities that cause harm to society and the environment, and the problem of social costs is a kind of externality. The genesis of the concept of “social costs” was an article Coase wrote in 1959 on the FCC in the U.S., in which he argued that interference with radio signals was a harmful externality that the market could resolve.", "sample_id": 59}
