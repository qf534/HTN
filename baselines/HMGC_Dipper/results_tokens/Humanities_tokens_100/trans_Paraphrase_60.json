{"x": "In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of the visual arts are painting, sculpture and architecture. Art is a diverse and multifarious field of human activity, and its resulting products are usually, if not always, the expression of creativity or imagination, in the production of which one recognizes and praises the skill, beauty, force or thematic idea. And that is how we call art. Theatre, dance, other types of performance, literature, music, film, and other media such as digital art, are part of the art world.", "sample_id": 0}
{"x": "Through the ages philosophers, such as Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, have questioned the meaning of art. The English words for art, artificial, artifact, artifice, medicine, and the military arts all derive from this meaning. Socrates is quoted in Plato as saying that poetry comes from the muses and is not rational. He also talks favorably of Homer’s epic poetry and criticism.", "sample_id": 1}
{"x": "At last, the forms differ in the manner of imitating, whether by a narration or by a characterization, by change or by immobility, by drama or by the lack of it. The forms also differ in the object of their imitation. Comedy, for example, is the dramatic imitation of men who are worse than the average, whereas tragedy imitates people who are better than the average. The modern and special sense of the word “art” as an abbreviation for the “art of invention” is one which Aristotle held to be natural to man, and one of the advantages that distinguish him from the beasts.", "sample_id": 2}
{"x": "Often, if it is used in a practical or common way, it is considered a craft and not an art; in the same way, if it is used in a business or industrial way, it is considered a commercial art rather than an art. According to some scholars, such as Kant, it is possible to distinguish between science and art, in which science is viewed as a body of knowledge, and art as a body of free artistic expression. As a result, the artisanry and the art of design can be classified as the opposite of the two.", "sample_id": 3}
{"x": "There was a beginning of the theory of form in the philosophy of Kant; it was further developed in the early twentieth century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood asserted the idealism of a work of art as a way of communicating feelings from one person to another. Leo Tolstoy saw art as a way of communicating indirectly, without a middleman. There are, however, also recent theories which take the work of art as a kind of mirror, allowing the viewer to see his own emotions.", "sample_id": 4}
{"x": "The oldest work of art in Europe is the griffin from the cave of the oxhorn, which dates back 51,000 years and was created by Neanderthals. In a cave of South Africa, tiny snail shells, dated about 75,000 years ago, have been found; as for containers that could have contained color, they are 100,000 years old. As for sculptures, cave paintings, engravings and petroglyphs, they are not older than 30,000 years.", "sample_id": 5}
{"x": "And thus, in the history of Greek art, there was a triumph of the human figure, which made the study of the anatomical physiognomy very much sought after, as well as the technique of representing its muscles, balance, beauty and correct proportions. As a result of the longevity and size of these civilizations, their art has survived and transmitted to other ages. It is also from them that we have received some of the first records of the working methods of the artists. And, in the Byzantine art and in the art of the Middle Ages, a large part of the art consisted of religious subjects.", "sample_id": 6}
{"x": "All the different kinds of Chinese art were well developed. We know that in the Tang Dynasty, painting was simple and calm, and the subject was the picturesque. In the Ming Dynasty, it was colourful and lively. Poetry, music, drama, painting, porcelain, the works of Emperor Qin, pottery, and so on, were highly developed.", "sample_id": 7}
{"x": "In the twentieth century, the process of world intercommunications has been proceeding, with its corresponding impact on the art of Western Europe. So the artistic categories of impressionism, expressionism, fauvism, cubism, dadaism, surrealism, etc. cannot be considered as fixed after the date of their creation. Later, African sculpture was taken up by Picasso and others. Then it was African sculpture that influenced, to a certain extent, the further development of cubism.", "sample_id": 8}
{"x": "A work of art, then, is not merely a representation of a truth, but a true for the community. This is the concept of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger in his book “The Origin of the Work of Art.” Heidegger makes an intriguing analogy between the concept of truth and the concept of being: truth not only expresses a part of a culture, but is also a part of it, and provides a point from which to find truth.", "sample_id": 9}
{"x": "Generally speaking, there are three schools of thought about the philosophy of art: the schools of form, content and setting. Form, that is to say, concerns the methods employed by the artist, and the physical appearance of the work, essentially the non-semantic elements of the work (its figure) such as colour, contour, dimension, tone, melody, space, texture and value. Then there are the design elements such as order, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, harmony and rhythm.", "sample_id": 10}
{"x": "Extreme intentionalism is equally objectionable to the philosophers. They admit that art has several and ambiguous meanings, and that the author's intention may be unknowable and therefore irrelevant. In fact, they argue, it is better to \"embrace the other extreme of idealism\" and that “an author's intention is not simply a concept in the mind of the artist, but rather the objectively unknowable essence of the work of art. That is to say, the work of art may be an image of God beyond time and space. The meaning of art is understood as being in the cultural context. It is the ideas, emotions, and reactions that art provokes in people.", "sample_id": 11}
{"x": "On the eve of the twentieth century, the virtuosity of John Singer Sargent, in turn, was applauded and distrusted. Traditionally, the qualities of skill and ease in the execution of an art were deemed inseparable from the art itself, and were therefore necessary to the art’s success. For Leonardo da Vinci, for example, art was no more nor less than his other activities, a manifestation of skill.", "sample_id": 12}
{"x": "The whole fame of Damien Hirst rests on the way he can find original ideas, but the production of his work is actually nothing more than the assembly of found objects. For most of the work, Hirst himself had to outsource most of the creative process to hired artisans. A resoundingly acclaim for artists who make art directly is not exactly a new thing. Many of the modern and contemporary artists who excel in the practical skills of drawing and painting and in the creation of handicrafts have done so for years.", "sample_id": 13}
{"x": "By this natural gift, people began to develop their special skills, and eventually their crude improvisations gave birth to poetry. Imitation is thus one of our natural instincts. Next comes the instinct for harmony and rhythm; metre is, in fact, rhythm broken up into sections. Art is a way of experiencing oneself in relation to the universe; and one may have this experience unconsciously as one admires the work of art. Aristotle said: ‘The experience of the mysterious is the experience of the self in relation to the universe.’", "sample_id": 14}
{"x": "In many societies, art serves as a decoration or symbol in the rituals, performances, and dances of that society. Though these often have no special utilitarian or motivational purpose, anthropologists know that they frequently have a purpose in the sphere of meaning for a given culture. Most scholars who study rock art recognize that this meaning is not given by a single individual but is rather the result of generations of change and cosmological relationships within a culture.", "sample_id": 15}
{"x": "However, not all content has to be scholarly. Maps are an example. Emotions, moods, and feelings can also be expressed through art. Art as entertainment. It may be an attempt to create a mood or emotion, to relax or entertain the viewer. It consists of artifacts or images with symbolic meanings, and serves as a means of communication. Art as provocation. This is the role of film and games.", "sample_id": 16}
{"x": "In that case, art may have been used for social criticism. It may be seen that, while this is almost the same as art for political change, subversive or deconstructive art questions the existing social order without any political purpose. Certain forms of art, such as graffiti and other forms of street art, make use of the fact that a public place is publicly accessible and that its elements may be placed in the midst of people without their permission.", "sample_id": 17}
{"x": "The result of the creative act is not the primary goal, but the act itself. The process is to be healed. For example, in the Diagnostic Drawing series, the patient's personality and emotional functioning are examined, the result of the creative act can serve as a guide to the treatment method in the clinical practice. Art is often used as a means of propaganda. Art for propaganda or commercial purposes.", "sample_id": 18}
{"x": "The functions of art are not always mutually exclusive; they may overlap. For example, an art form whose function is to provide amusement may also serve as a commercial tool, such as a movie or a video game. The steps in art creation may be divided into any number of stages. This section divides art creation into three broad stages, but there is no agreed-upon number of stages. Preparation - The first stage is the artist's mental preparation for the creation.", "sample_id": 19}
{"x": "According to the journals of education, the experience of art is considered to be an essential part of the process. The major aspect of art is that others can view and enjoy it. In a survey conducted by the American Association of Art, over half of the students surveyed considered reflection an essential part of the artistic process. Many are concerned with the question of whether the work of art has succeeded or failed, but art has a profound value, beyond its commercial value, as a source of social information and health.", "sample_id": 20}
{"x": "In the Near East cylinder seals were used both for decoration and convenience. When coinage became a common means of payment, it too became an art form, a visual art form that could be appreciated by all classes of society. The ease of reproducing works with molds, as happened in the case of Roman pottery and Greek Tanagra figurines, led to the development of a mass-production industry that pushed the sale of such wares into the millions. In Europe, in the fifteenth century, a second great innovation appeared.", "sample_id": 21}
{"x": "Many of the lords’ castles and palaces, and the art treasures in the homes of the upper classes, were often open to the public, and the public could often view large portions of these collections—often on the condition that they be paid a small fee, or wear the right clothes, irrespective of who they were. The Egyptian temples are a typical example: the most massive and richly decorated parts are those accessible to the public, not the inner, innermost ones, reserved for the priests.", "sample_id": 22}
{"x": "A startling fact is that the Louvre, which opened to the public in 1793, was a transfer of royal property to the republican state, but a democratic revolution was only one element in a broader trend. A few years earlier, before the French Revolution, Madrid had already built the Prado Palace for the public display of part of the royal collection, and similar public museums for the regal art collection existed in Vienna, Munich, and other capitals.", "sample_id": 23}
{"x": "“One mustn’t present just simple objects,” the prominent German artist Joseph Beuys proclaimed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, one of the most fundamental drives of much art was to make art that couldn’t be bought and sold. Artists have tried to make art that couldn’t be bought by the wealthy as a status symbol. During this time, such art forms as performance art, video art, and conceptual art were created. The main aims of these are to make art that has no price.", "sample_id": 24}
{"x": "The opinions of critics and the philanthropists, the most powerful industry in the world, are invariably expressed in criticism of art, and the opinions of collectors are not always consistent with each other. As for the discussion of art, there is a long history of art being condemned by a certain group of critics, and a variety of reasons. But when in the early 2000s DVD recording technology became widespread, the gallery system which profits from the sale of works of art, came to have an important tool for establishing and distributing a limited edition of digital and analog art to collectors. The privilege of status became an understanding of the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the arts remain the prerogative of the upper classes.", "sample_id": 25}
{"x": "Théodore Géricault’s Raft of the Medusa, 1819 (left). Throughout the history of art, the content of a great deal of formal art has been decided by the patron rather than the artist, but with the coming of Romanticism and changes in the economics of art, the vision of the artist became the principal determinant of content, which has led to a higher rate of controversy, if sometimes to a lower level of intensity. Strong incentives, both for the consideration of originality and for publicity, have been present in the minds of many artists.", "sample_id": 26}

{"x": "The art critic Clement Greenberg, in his 1960 article ‘Modernist Painting’, defined modern art as ‘the use of a formal method to criticize that very method’. Greenberg originally used this concept to explain the abstract expressionist movement, which is why he saw its flat art as a valid contribution to modern art. In the late nineteenth century the advent of modern art brought a radical change in the view of the function of art, and the same thing happened in the twentieth century with the advent of postmodernism.", "sample_id": 28}
{"x": "Duchamp declared once that art was everything—everything. The art of the eighties, nineties and now is far wider than high art, encompassing popular art, fashion, comics, billboards, and pornography. Artists of the era, such as Andy Warhol, had to make their mark by criticizing, and thereby demeaning, the world of art, and the popular world of art. It is however surprising that in the postmodern world only certain activities are classified as art.", "sample_id": 29}

Besides these, the term art has become the root of a great number of English words, such as “artefact”, “artificial”, “artifice”, “medical art”, “military art”, “air power”, etc., all of which have a common origin. For instance, Plato asked the following fundamental questions concerning art in various dialogues:", "sample_id": 33}

{"x": "All through the 19th and 20th centuries, the emergence of a great many artistic movements is a result of the gradual increase of international communication, which has allowed cross-cultural exchanges to take place and to have a great influence on Western art. Impressionism, expression, Fauvism, Cubism, dadaism, surrealism are artistic movements that were born in this period. Among the many influences from Japanese art, one is particularly noticeable.", "sample_id": 38}
{"x": "A philosophy which excludes the immanent, is sometimes criticised by critics. This maxim seems to be too limiting, because art is ambiguous, has many meanings, and the artist's intention is often unknown or unimportant. Similarly, in the interpretation of art, a concept which transcends time and space is invariably intermingled with the question of the absoluteness of God. For this a critic has argued that this way of looking at art is “socially unhealthy, philosophically unrealistic and politically dangerous.”", "sample_id": 39}
{"x": "Art philosophy can be divided into three main schools, formalistic analysis, content-related analysis, and emotional analysis. Artistic analysis means that the compositional principles of art are primarily a matter of non-semantic features, such as color, line, dimension, material, melody, space, texture, and value; and the principles of composition, such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, rhythm, and so on.", "sample_id": 40}
{"x": "During his lifetime, Rembrandt, who is now so appreciated for his ephemeral qualities, was admired above all for his technical virtuosity. In the past, the mastery of execution has been an essential part of art, an indispensable ingredient of its success. In the case of Leonardo da Vinci, art was the direct expression of the mastery of skill, which he also showed in his other works. When Sargent's virtuosity was admired and criticized at the beginning of the twentieth century, the art of the masters was not so controversial.", "sample_id": 41}
{"x": "Starting with this innate capacity, individuals gradually developed their own particular talents and thus produced poetry through their initial improvisations. The fundamental instinct in man is imitation. Aristotle observed that this was accompanied by a natural inclination towards harmony and rhythm, and that verses are parts of rhythm. For man’s whole life he seeks harmony and rhythm. Music and poetry are the means he employs in his search for harmony and rhythm. Art is the way in which man finds himself.", "sample_id": 42}
{"x": "In the art of today, the creation process often consists in the bringing together of found objects, a practice that has come to define the very concept of ‘conceptual art’. Damien Hirst is known for the cerebral design of his art, and often entrusts its execution to skilled craftsmen. His position in the art world is largely the result of his reputation as a creator of startling concepts. Nevertheless, despite this trend, a great number of modern and contemporary artists still produce art of the highest quality, with a distinct emphasis on painting and drawing, and so on.", "sample_id": 43}
{"x": "It is acknowledged by anthropologists that the artistic expression of a culture does not necessarily have a purely utilitarian purpose, but usually carries within it a significance that has developed over the generations and reflects a relationship with the cosmology inherent in the culture itself. Art plays an important role in many cultures in the performance, ritual and dance, often as a symbol. But if we try to find a utilitarian explanation for prehistoric art, which is often purely decorative, ritualistic or symbolical, it often becomes difficult.", "sample_id": 44}

{"x": "It is the art that is the medium of personal expression, but art is also a vehicle for communication and reflection, for the way in which it allows others to understand and appreciate the value of what it is. Research shows that reflection is recognized by a high proportion of art students as an essential part of the artistic process. Art plays a vital role in society by informing and influencing. Often the quality and success of art are discussed, but its significance goes far beyond its commercial success.", "sample_id": 46}
{"x": "The opening of the Louvre in 1793 during the French Revolution, constituted a new epoch in the history of public access to art, inasmuch as it transferred ownership of the former royal collection to the republican State. The building in which the Prado now is, built before the French Revolution to accommodate the public exhibition of part of the royal collection, corresponds to other galleries, public and royal, that have existed in other cities, such as Vienna and Munich.

{"x": "In addition to temples, many royal palaces, castles and palaces of the socially important were open to the public in some of their parts. The main decorations of the Egyptian temples were mostly in the parts that the public could see.

The collections in these places were often accessible to the public, either for free or for a nominal fee.", "sample_id": 50}
{"x": "According to Steve Mithen, art is a production of artifacts or images which are charged with symbolic meaning and are used as a medium of communication. Art often seeks to evoke particular emotions or feelings, to provide the viewer with relaxation or entertainment. It is a multifaceted medium of communication, transferring not only scientific concepts but also emotions, moods, and feelings. This purpose is particularly obvious in the art industries, such as film and computer games, which exist to entertain the audience.", "sample_id": 51}
{"x": "Using the cylinder seals for both practical and artistic purposes, the rising bourgeoisie of the Near East used them to stamp the “Arab-bet” on the parcels they sent out, but in the emergence of a coin economy, coins became an art form that went through various strata of society.

In Europe, a significant innovation occurred in the fifteenth century.", "sample_id": 52}
{"x": "One of the basic concerns of the artist in the late sixties and seventies was to create art that transcended the usual economic framework. The post-war German artist Joseph Beuys formulated this approach: “It is necessary to present something more than merely material objects.” Throughout history, artists have strove to create art that resists commodity and is not available to the wealthy as a status symbol.

It was an evolution that implied the increasing centrality of art as a class activity. It has always been a privileged way of making money, and this new technology, allowing the artists to sell limited editions to collectors, gave them still more control over the distribution of their works.", "sample_id": 54}
{"x": "It is a fact that the history of art, inasmuch as it is a historical art, has been subject to the direction of patrons and patronesses, as well as of artists, to some extent. This has led to an increase in the controversy which surrounds the art, the significance of which varies from work to work. With the emergence of Romanticism and the considerable changes in the economy of art, the artist’s individual vision has increasingly dominated the content of the art; the resulting controversy has had an increasingly significant effect on the artistic content. With a view to their originality and to attracting public attention, the artists, often on the grounds of controversy, made their works more accessible to the public, which gave them a sense of freedom.", "sample_id": 55}
{"x": "Intentionalism and formalism, whose relationship Gaut and Livingston examine, are two distinct schools of critical thought. Formalisms posit that in order to give a correct reading of a work, one must be cognizant of the intentions of the artist; whereas the intentionalists claim that one must give a correct reading of the work without any consideration of the artist’s intentions. The act of creation is interesting, but not necessary for its proper interpretation.
