{"x": "In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of art are painting, sculpture and architecture. Art is a concept referring to a variety of human activities and their products, which generally express an original or inventive talent and often beauty, sentiment, thought or a conceptual idea. As such, art can be applied to any kind of knowledge, and until the seventeenth century it was not distinguished from either the sciences or the handicrafts. In the modern period, aesthetic considerations are placed above all and, as such, the fine arts are distinguished from the arts in general, for example, from the decorative and applied arts. The theatre, dance, other performing arts, literature, music, film and other media such as the interactive media are included in the wider definition of the arts. In the view of the history of art, art objects have existed almost as long as humanity, from prehistoric art to modern art. Some theorists, however, deny that art objects are properly seen outside of the Western context. Art and the various concepts of art, such as creativity, are studied in aesthetics, a part of philosophy. The resulting artefacts are studied in art criticism and art history.", "sample_id": 0}
{"x": "Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and Immanuel Kant among others, have passed on to us their questions about the nature of art. From this meaning the English words artifact, artificial, artifice, surgical art, medical art, military art, etc., have been derived. But there are also many other meanings in common usage, all of which are related to its etymology. Various Plato dialogues deal with questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational, approves of this and other divine insanities such as drunkenness, lust, and dreams in Phaedrus (265a-267b), but then, in the Republic, wants to ban Homer’s great art, as well as laughter. But in Ion Socrates makes no such protest. In his analysis of literature and music, Aristotle sees epic, tragedy, comedy, the disyrambic, and music as imitative, or mimetic, art, differing only in the mode, object, and manner of imitation. The dialogue Ion (scroll 36c) suggests that the Iliad of Homer was to the Greeks what the Bible is to the Christian world: inspired literature that can be of moral value, if one knows how to interpret it.", "sample_id": 1}
{"x": "Lastly, these forms differ in the way they imitate: by narrative or by character, by the state of change or without change, by drama or without drama. They also differ in the subject matter of their imitation. Comedy, for example, is the dramatic imitation of the bad, the tragic of the good. Art, in its more recent sense, which has a more precise meaning, as an abbreviation of creative art or fine art, was introduced at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Art is the artist’s power to express his genius, to arouse the spectator’s aesthetic sense, to draw him to a more refined and nobler way of appreciating art. Aristotle thought that art was a natural human capacity, and that it was one of man’s superiorities over the beasts. It is something that through the senses arouses in the individual, thought, emotion, belief or idea. The creative arts (art as a discipline) are a group of disciplines which produce objects (art as art), works prompted by personal desire (art as activity), able to communicate a message, a state, a symbolism, a message to the spectator (art as experience). In this sense, art can mean several things: a) a study of a creative art, b) a process of using the creative art, c) the product of the creative art, or d) the spectator’s experience of the creative art.", "sample_id": 2}
{"x": "For the sciences, if applied to a common or practical end, are generally termed trades instead of art; for the arts, if applied to a commercial or industrial end, are called commercial arts instead of fine arts. Some philosophers, such as Kant, separate the sciences and the arts by treating the former as a domain of knowledge, and the latter as a domain of artistic liberty. Some lovers of art have declared that the difference between the fine and the practical arts depends on the judgments made about them, and not on a difference of definition. But even the fine arts often have ends which are not only the result of their inspiration and self-expression. Artisanship and design are sometimes called applied arts. The nature of art, according to Richard Wollheim, is one of the most enigmatic of the traditional problems of human culture. The end of the work of art is often the expression of an idea, such as in works which are philosophical, political, or ecclesiastical, the creation of a beauty (see aesthetics), the exploration of perception, pleasure, or emotion. Or the purpose of the work of art may be unknown. The arts have been defined as the expression or evocation of emotions and ideas, as the exploration and the use of formal elements for their own sake, as a mimesis or as a representation.", "sample_id": 3}
{"x": "Art as Form has its origin in the ideas of Kant, and in the early part of the century was developed by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood were of the view that art is the expression of emotion and that art, therefore, exists in its essence in the mind of the creator. Leo Tolstoy pointed to art as a means of indirect communication between people. According to Larry Shiner, art is neither essence nor fate, but something we have created. Those influenced by Heidegger have more recently interpreted art as the medium by which a community develops its own particular means of self-expression and interpretation. George Dickie has given us an institutional theory of art, in which a work of art is defined as a product, in which a group of persons has, in the name of the social institution commonly known as “the art world,” recognized as ‘fit to be appreciated’. It was during the romantic period that art came to be regarded as “a special faculty of the human mind, along with religion and science.” Art can be defined by its mimesis (its ability to represent the real), by its narration (its ability to tell a story), by its expression, by its communication of emotion, and so on. In the form in which we generally understand it, art is only about two hundred years old in Europe. Since the first drawings by Homo erectus have been dated from between 430,000 and 540,000 years ago, it is probable that we can assume that art predates the development of humanity.", "sample_id": 4}
{"x": "The oldest trace of art in Europe is the Great Turtle of the Höhle of the Earhorns, a 51,000-year-old work of Neanderthal. Containers, perhaps for the paint, which could have been used at least 100,000 years ago, have been found. In a South African cave a whole series of tiny, drilled snail shells, about 75,000 years old, have been found. This neolithic artistic masterpiece, like the Venus of the Höhle Fels, is the oldest undisputedly sculpted figure in human art and the first artistic instruments, 43,000 to 35,000 years old, is the oldest place of human art. Many great artistic traditions have their foundations in the art of ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome and Olmec. The meaning of the art of the Upper Paleolithic, as in the case of the Venus of the Höhle Fels, and similar works from the World Heritage of the Swabian Jura Caves, has been disputed, but the materiality of the events is the newest clue.", "sample_id": 5}
{"x": "This Greek period, for example, saw a great attention paid to the human form, and an equal and brilliant skill was developed to show the musculature, the beauty, and the proportions. Also, because of the long duration of these civilizations, more of their art has survived, and more of their influence has been transmitted to other civilizations and later times. And some have also left the first records of the methods employed by the artist. And so, while the Byzantines and the Middle Ages of the West showed a greater attention to the subjects of the Bible and the Christian culture, they also used a style of art that highlighted the greatness and majesty of the world of God, with gold in the backgrounds of the paintings, with the use of glass in mosaics or stained glass windows, which showed the figures in idealized, flat shapes. But the classicistic tradition continued in small pieces of Byzantine art, and the realism grew steadily in the art of the Catholics of Europe. Further east, in the same way, religion predominated in the art forms. In the East, Islamic art, with the absence of iconography, had a predilection for the geometric, the calligraphy, and the architecture.", "sample_id": 6}
{"x": "The artistic styles of China varied from time to time and are known by the name of the reigning Emperor. The style of painting, for instance, during the Tang Dynasty is mainly monochrome and simple, focusing on the natural form and the beauty of the landscape, while the style of the Ming is more colourful, lively and more illustrative. China has developed many different arts, including the sculpturing of stone, metalwork, pottery, terracotta figures, poetry, music, painting, drama, and fiction. Artistic styles in the West during the Enlightenment period in the eighteenth century reflect the universal principles of the clockwork universe and the political and revolutionary visions of the world after the abolition of the monarchy. For example, the representation of Newton as a divine geometer in the work of William Blake or the propagandistic images in the works of Jacques-Louis David. In Japan, too, artistic styles were linked to the reigning Emperors. In the West, the late nineteenth century saw a series of artistic movements, such as Academicism, Symbolism, Impressionistic art, Fauvism, and Fauvist art. This was followed by Romanticism, which rejected these ideas and depicted the individualism and emotional aspects of people as portrayed, for instance, in the works of Goethe.", "sample_id": 7}
{"x": "The growing interrelation of the nations at this period produced an equal and reciprocal influence of the other civilizations on the European art. So it is that the characterization of the art of Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc., cannot be sustained far beyond the period in which they were fashioned. Similar influences of the West on the Orient in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries had also produced an incalculable effect. Such ideas as Marxism, existentialism, and post-modernism, derived from the West, were of the greatest importance in China and the Far East. Japanese prints, which were, however, themselves deeply influenced by the artistic productions of the Renaissance, have profoundly affected the paintings of the impressionists, and have inspired later artists like Picasso and Matisse. The idea of absolute truth in art, which had become a fashionable illusion in the later twentieth century, had been displaced by the notion that all artistic expression is relative, and that the only way to regard and appreciate the various cultures of the world and of history is with irony and skepticism. The search for truth as an ideal gave place to the post-modernist realisation that there was no truth, and that the only truth in art was that it was relative. In 1970 Theodor W. Adorno declared:", "sample_id": 8}
{"x": "Art is not a representation of the things that exist, but produces them, makes them accessible to a community. Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher of extreme importance, defines art as the use of truth. He points out that art not only expresses the element of truth in the culture, but also creates it and makes it accessible, gives it the stage from which it emerges and which is actually revealed. Art and artistic knowledge have often spread through trade. An example is the Silk Road, where Hellenistic, Indian, and Chinese influences could mingle. With each new art that enters a culture, the very meaning of existence is changed. The contact of different cultures and different worldviews also influenced artistic creation. An example is the multilingual port city of Trieste at the beginning of the twentieth century, where James Joyce and writers from Central Europe met, and the artistic development of New York as a melting pot. Greco-Buddhist art is one of the most striking examples of this phenomenon. Artistic creations are often classified into a smaller number of categories, usually in the form of perceptible differences, such as materials, genres, styles, and forms.", "sample_id": 9}
{"x": "There are three schools of art philosophy, which deal respectively with form, matter, and style. Form is concerned with the methods employed by the artist, and the material composition of the picture, particularly with the non-semantic elements, such as colour, outline, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, value; and also with the principles of design, such as arrangement, balance, emphasis, harmony, proportion, spacing, and rhythm. Matter is the matter that the artist employs, and the formal qualities of his work; but the elements of the latter are not precisely defined, and it is even difficult to give them a common name. Formalism is the theory that all the artistic properties are formal, that is to say, part of the formal character of the work. Philosophers almost unanimously deny that all artistic properties are formal, and argue that they go beyond form and matter. Extreme intentionalism maintains that the main content of a work of art lies in the intention of the author; he who represents the persons and ideas, he is the subject, and the content is the artist’s experience of his subject. Some authors speak of the matter and the content of the work, that is, of the denotations and connotations; others prefer the terms meaning and significance. An example of the latter is the composition of Napoleon I on his imperial throne, partly based on the statue of Zeus in Olympia.", "sample_id": 10}
{"x": "Its restricted interpretation is “socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically inexpedient.” It is precisely the same with 'intentionalism’ as with 'formalism’. ‘As the form may be ambiguous, so may the intention of the author. It may be unknowable and consequently irrelevant.’ The result is the same: a new conception of art, which takes into account not only the form and the intention of the author, but also the context of the piece of work as such, in the sense of the reactions, associations, and occurrences it evokes. The context is often restricted to the author’s intentions and methods, in which case the system of thought develops in the same way as in formalism and intentionalism. It is skill and craftsmanship, in the sense of the capable handling of a material, the fluent and efficient use of a language for the express or profound meaning of the work. The criticism of art also develops. A relation of understanding with the material, the result of the mastery of it, stimulates the thinking. Art is an act of expression of feelings, thoughts, and observations.", "sample_id": 11}
{"x": "During the first decade of the twentieth century the dexterity of John Singer Sargent was sometimes admired, sometimes deplored, as a sign of his handicraft, but almost at the same time, the artist who was to be the period’s most notorious iconoclast, Pablo Picasso, was completing his apprenticeship as a classical painter, in which he excelled. The genius of a painter, that of Rembrandt, now admired for its immaterial virtues, was then chiefly admired for his virtuosity; the work of Rembrandt, now so valued for its ephemeral charms, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. In the field of conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain was one of the first works to be based on the use of ready-made objects and to be created without the use of the skills generally recognized as the province of the artist. In this they were followed by the works of Emin, and of Hirst, that are both mass-media events. One of the prevailing contemporary criticisms of some modern art is that it has no discernible skill.", "sample_id": 12}
{"x": "In his mind's eye he conceives and conceives the idea for his picture, while the rest is generally made up of found materials. His fame is built solely on his talent for conceiving surprising ideas. In fact, most of the artist's work is made up of found objects. The function of art has varied greatly over the centuries, making it impossible to reduce its purpose to a single concept. This does not mean that the function of art is vague, but that it has had many different and distinctive functions. Nevertheless, there are also a great many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to perfect their artistic skills in drawing and painting, and in creating original works of art with their own hands. Art is said to serve different functions, but they can be divided into two groups: the non-instrumental and the instrumental. The non-instrumental functions of art are those that are inherent in man, which go beyond the individual, and which are not the result of a specific external purpose. We shall now discuss some of these functions. Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm are inherent in human nature, and only human nature can create such a thing as art. In this sense art, like all creativity, is part of the human nature that can be attributed to man, which no other animal possesses, and therefore has no instrumental function.", "sample_id": 13}
{"x": "So, starting from this natural gift, man by degrees developed his special aptitudes, and by force of improvisations gave birth to poetry. So imitation is one of the instincts of our nature. Then comes the instinct for harmony and rhythm, meters being evidently divisions of rhythm. Hence a person may feel his relation to the universe without any deliberate intention, in admiring art, music, and poetry. Experience of the mysterious.—Aristotle. Expression of the imagination.—Einstein. The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious, and it is the source of all true art and science. Jupiter’s eagle, an example of art, is not, like the logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the greatness and majesty of creation, but is something else, and calls up for the imagination an infinity of related pictures, and causes the thought to run in many directions, beyond the possibility of formulating it in the form of a word. Art gives means of expression to the imagination in a way which is not grammatical and not dependent on the grammatic formality of spoken or written language.", "sample_id": 14}
{"x": "“Art serves as a decoration or symbol in the rituals, ceremonies, and dances of many cultures. While anthropologists know that they seldom have a utilitarian or even intellectual purpose, they know that they serve a cultural purpose at the level of meaning. This meaning is not a product of any individual artist, but rather is the result of many generations of change, a result of a cosmic relationship within the culture. - Silva Tomaskova, skeptics of art, mostly scholars, dealing with rock paintings or prehistoric objects that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms, and are therefore categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are well aware of the trap that the term art creates. Art is, in its simplest form, communication. It is communication to bring about political change, social commentary, communication of a certain feeling or mood, the psychology of the individual, to illustrate other sciences, to sell goods with a commercial art, or to communicate in any way. In most forms of communication, the meaning and purpose is aimed at another person, and this is called an intentional purpose.", "sample_id": 15}
{"x": "The content of the art need not be scientific, however; it can also express emotions, moods, feelings. Maps are another example. Art may be a means of inducing a certain mood, in order to evoke that mood, and to entertain or distract the viewer. It is an object or image with a symbolic meaning as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen, Art as a means of entertainment. The avant-garde. Art as a political tool. This is the function of film and computer game industries. Contrariwise, the realism resulting from the influence of Positivism, as expressed by Thomas Aquinas and Anatole France, appears to me to be opposed to all intellectual or moral progress. Art movements which have this function, Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, Abstract Expressionism, etc., are collectively known as the avant-garde. The tendency is always deriving strength from the newspapers and stultifying both science and art by slavishly pandering to the lowest tastes, in a dog-eat-dog world. I hate it, for it consists of mediocrity, hatred and dull conceit. It is this tendency which produces today’s stale books and dull plays.

Art, as the case of Marina de Bris, is an example of raising public awareness of pollution. Art, as the case of Marina de Bris, fashion, is the art of fashion made of rubbish. The example of Marina de Bris, the upcycling of rubbish in fashion, which is an example of raising awareness of pollution, is just one of the many.

It has been argued that the human brain's abilities far exceed the needs of survival in the ancestral environment. In both cases, art is subtly influencing the viewer's emotional or psychological attitude towards a certain idea or product. Art as a meter of fitness. Supposedly, the feathers of the male peacock serve as a sexual attractant to attract females. (Cf. also \"Runaway Fisher\" and \"Handicap\"). Evolutionary psychology claims that the brain, and the features it generates (such as artistic abilities and creativity), is the human equivalent of the peacock's tail.", "sample_id": 18}
{"x": "This way of using art is not exclusive of other functions. For example, art for entertainment can also be used to sell products: for example, a movie or a game. It is divided into steps and steps. In the first step the artist imagines the work. Steps There is no fixed number of steps in art. Artistic inspiration is one of the main forces of art and can be considered a matter of instinct, impressions and feelings. By imagining the artist starts the process of bringing art into existence. In preparation for art it is possible to approach and investigate the subject. For example, it has been said that the painting of Francisco de Goya was so sad because of his isolation and his experiences of war. Steps In the second step the artist makes the art. Trial and error are considered part of the creative process. The musicians of the band The Beatles have said that LSD and cannabis have inspired their greatest masterpieces, such as Revolver. It has been said that Goya painted directly on the walls of his house in Spain and probably did not discuss his paintings with anyone.", "sample_id": 19}
{"x": "Moreover, it is a fact that art is something for others. As can be seen from educational journals, reflection is a fundamental part of the experience of art. According to a study, more than half of visual arts students believe that reflection is an essential part of the creative process. Art can evoke a whole range of emotions. Many of those who view, listen, read, or experience art are mainly concerned with whether the work is good or not, but it has profound value as a source of social information and well-being. In the past, many of the most beautiful works of art have been intended to demonstrate wealth or power, and, as a result of their grand scale and costly materials, they have been reserved for the display of wealth or power by monarchs and religious institutions. Many more, less grand, works have been created by the affluent of society. Some art is meant to be a tool, to be analyzed in depth and to be discussed. Although in some periods of history art of high quality has been available to large sections of society in the form of ownership, these have been mainly in cheaper media, such as clay pottery that lasts for a long time in the ground, or in other more perishable media such as textiles and wood.", "sample_id": 20}
{"x": "Is it possible to find that seals, artistic and useful, were also extremely popular in ancient Near East and were used as medium-class money? Once coinage was widely used, art also spread to the lowest ranks of society. Reproductive techniques such as molding allowed very high-quality pottery, Greek terracotta figurines, and Roman tin-glazed pottery to reach a wide audience. Prints of all kinds have been decorating homes and public spaces for centuries. The print was expensive at first, but it gradually became cheaper and cheaper, and by the 19th century, the very poor could afford illustrated books. Another important development was made in the 15th century in Europe when small woodcuts, mostly religious and often very small and hand-colored, were published and were even sold to the lowest people who glued them to the walls of their homes. It was from this religious enthusiasm that the city of Basel, in Switzerland, founded the first art museum in the world, the Kunstmuseum Basel. The museum is known today for its impressively wide collection from the early 15th century to the present day, its own unique focus, and international importance. Its collection consists of two parts, one of which is a collection of paintings and drawings by artists in the upper Rhine region from 1400 to 1600 and the other of art from the 20th and 21st centuries.", "sample_id": 21}
{"x": "In some cases royal and private collections were arranged so that the public could see them, as with the Orleans collection, which was housed in the Hôtel Orléans, one of the wings of the Palais Royal in Paris, which was accessible for most of the eighteenth century. Egyptian temples, for example, are best known for their elaborate decoration, which was mostly confined to the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than to the parts reserved for the priesthood. Many palaces, castles and the mansions of the noble classes were open to the public, and large parts of the collections of such people could often be seen by the public, sometimes for a small fee, sometimes only to those who had enough money, or those who were dressed in a certain way, regardless of their origin or status (in the Palace of Versailles, the necessary dress accessories, such as a sword and buckler, could be borrowed from shops outside). Even before the beginning of the Renaissance, in Italy, art tourism was a major industry, and governments and towns did their best to allow access to important works.", "sample_id": 22}
{"x": "The opening of the Louvre in 17993, as a public museum and the transfer of ownership to the republic, was certainly a significant stage in the development of public access to art, but it continued a well-established trend. The building that now houses the Prado was already planned before the French Revolution to house a part of the royal collection, and similar royal art galleries, open to the public, were in existence in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. The present public museums and art education for children in schools can be traced back to this drive to make art accessible to all. The museums of the United States are mostly founded by the very rich and dedicated to the people. But museums do not just make art accessible, they also influence how it is seen by the public. Studies show that museums not only make art accessible, they also influence how the public sees art. The most recent study of the public taste was done by the Metropolitan Museum in New York, a rich man’s art collection. The founder was John Taylor Johnston, a railway man.", "sample_id": 23}
{"x": "“One must present something that is not simply an object,” said the great postwar German artist Joseph Beuys. One of the basic intentions of much art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to produce art that was not commodifiable. There have been attempts to produce art that cannot be bought by the wealthy as a status symbol. Democratic concepts concerning the commodification of art, which first germinated in the mid-1960s and were realized in the 1970s, spurred the aesthetic innovations of that period, which brought us performance art, video art, and conceptual art. The reasoning goes that if art is a performance that leaves nothing behind or is an idea, then it cannot be bought and sold. In the decades since, however, those ideas have been somewhat tarnished, because the art market has been able to sell limited-edition DVDs of videos, tickets to exclusive performance art events, and leftovers from conceptual art. Many of those who identify broadly with the concept of “conceptual art” have, in exchange for painterly and sculptural practices, instead engaged in performance and publishing activities...

{"x": "One of the problems of art is that it has long been controversial, that is, unpopular with some people for various reasons, but most of these controversies have been recorded very badly or have been lost to view. With the spread of DVD in the early years of the century, artists and galleries, which derive their profit from the sale of art, found an effective way to control the sale of digital and moving image art, in limited editions to collectors. Hence the standard of distinction becomes knowledge rather than ownership, but art remains a high-class occupation. Aniconism, a general opposition to all images, or often only religious ones, has been a feature of several major religions. It is a key feature of Islamic art, especially where depictions of Muhammad have been controversial. Iconoclasm is the destruction of art objects which for one reason or another are not liked. There are many reasons why art can be unpopular. In late medieval times the appearance of the Virgin and Child was controversial because of its portrayal of a new idea of the Virgin's lust, and of her adultery with the thief.

The content of the grandiose art of the past has been determined, as a rule, by the order of the commissioning prince, but with the advent of Romanticism, and with the economic changes which took place in the production of art, the artistic inspiration has become the determining factor of the content of the art, which increased the frequency of controversies, though not always their significance. (About 1860) “Still Life” by Raphael. The gradual renunciation of naturalism and the realistic portrayal of the external appearance of objects in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries gave rise to a long-standing controversy lasting for more than a century. Édouard Manet's \"Le déjeuner sur l'herbe\" (1863) was scandalized, not by the nakedness of the female subject, but by the fact that the men next to her were fully dressed, not in antiquity. John Singer Sargent's Madame Pierre Gautreau, Madame X (1884), was scandalized by the reddish ocher colour of the woman's earlobe, which was considered too suggestive and could ruin the reputation of the lordly model.", "sample_id": 26}

Leon Golub’s Interrogation III from 1981 depicts a naked female prisoner with her hood drawn, strapped to a chair, her legs spread apart revealing her genitalia, and two men in ordinary clothes standing around her, interrogating her. The aesthetician John Ruskin, whose principle of naturalism was advocated by J. M. W. Turner, saw art’s task as the artificially contrived communication of the essential truth of nature. Before the advent of modernism, the aesthetics of Western art was very concerned with the appropriate balance between various aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal; and these ratios have changed and varied from time to time. This concern is almost entirely absent in other traditions of art. As of the 20th century, the definition and evaluation of art has become a particularly difficult problem.", "sample_id": 27}
{"x": "The epoch of Modernism had ushered in a radical change in the conception of the role of art, which was radically changed again in the twentieth century with the advent of postmodernism. In his 1960 article ‘Modernist Painting’, Clement Greenberg defines modernism as “the use of the characteristic methods of a discipline in order to criticise that discipline itself.” In other words, if realism and naturalism used the artistic means to hide the artistic means, then modernism would use the artistic means to draw attention to the artistic means. After Greenberg, important theorists were born, such as Michael Fried, T.J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock, among others. The limitations posed by the painting medium—the flatness of the surface, the shape of the canvas, the properties of paint—were treated by the old masters as negative factors, and were acknowledged only indirectly, whereas in the modernist period these limitations became positive factors and were openly acknowledged.", "sample_id": 28}

In the 80s, 90s and 00s, the swath of pop art has been widened to include all forms of cultural images, from fashion photography to comics, billboards and pornography. The work of Andy Warhol has been acclaimed and celebrated by integrating and possibly criticizing popular culture as well as the world of art. The art world today, which now counts only certain activities as art, is a socially constructed entity. We have evidence that this is so. In the book The Invention of Art, a cultural history, Shiner, the writer, tries to reconstruct the construction of the art system. Art, he says, was originally understood as any human activity, not as an art, not as a craft, because these are two categories that have emerged only later in human history.. Shiner offers historical evidence that before our current system of art, art consisted of all human activities, because the Greeks, for example, did not have the word art, but techne. It was used for both music, sculpture and painting, but also for medicine, cooking, riding, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, farming, etc.", "sample_id": 29}

Art, historically, until the seventeenth century, was any kind of skill, including craftsmanship and sciences; but since then, it has come to be distinguished from the applied arts and the crafts, and the distinction between the fine arts and other learned skills, such as the decorative and applied arts, has become more important. The broader definition of the arts includes theatre, dance, literature, music, film, and interactive media. Since prehistoric times, human beings have created artistic works, and from them the historical development of art to the modern day. The study of the philosophy of art, with its various ramifications, is called aesthetics, and the professional study of art criticism and art history explores the results of art, its creative process, and its influence on people. Although the concept of the 'works of art' is taken as a given, there is a theory that the 'works of art' is only really valid in modern Western societies.", "sample_id": 30}
{"x": "Chinese art has changed over the centuries, and each dynasty marks a distinct period of history, such as the simplicity of the monochrome paintings of the Tang Dynasty. Artistic genres have also been different, each time being a different style. The various genres of art in China are as many as the stone carving, bronze kilns, pottery, terracotta warriors, poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama and prose. But Japanese art is also divided according to the different periods, and Japanese painting and calligraphy are particularly combined. In contrast, the Ming Dynasty's painting is brightly colored, full of forms and layers, and many stories can be seen in its layout. In the West, the eighteenth century was the enlightenment era, when the artists of the time were also full of physical and rational features, such as the \"godly geometer\" of Isaac Newton by William Blake, the political pictures of Jacques-Louis David, etc. After the eighteenth century, the art of woodblock printing became more popular in Japan, which also helped to disseminate the works of art. The end of the nineteenth century was the era of many art styles, such as academic art, symbolism, etc., and the realism and romanticism were two extremes. After all, the realism of Goethe's paintings was a reaction against the enlightenment.", "sample_id": 31}
{"x": "The theory of art as form began with Kant, was extended by such theorists as Roger Fry and Clive Bell. Tolstoy defined art as a means of expressing sentiment. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood took this idea further, holding that art is a vehicle for the expression of emotion and arguing that the essence of a work of art is essentially contained in the mind of the artist. Also, as has been said, a tradition has developed among those who accept the theory of art as a mode of social expression, and the work of art as a work of art in which the artifice has been a tool of the artist, and which the artist has designed. L. Shiner maintained that a work of art is a concept, not an essence or fate, but something that has been created. George Dickie’s definition of a work of art was that it is a work of art only when it is designated by qualified individuals for appreciation by the social institution commonly known as the art world. The history of art began in prehistoric times, and art began to be considered in the Romantic period as a special faculty of the human mind, akin to religion and science. Art may be characterized by many qualities, such as mimesis (the imitation of reality), storytelling, and the expression of emotion.", "sample_id": 32}
{"x": "There are many notable philosophers who have pondered over the meaning of art, such as Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant. The word art has produced a number of English words: artifact, artificial, artificial, artifice, medical art, military art, all of which are related to its original meaning. Plato talks about art in a number of dialogues. For example, Socrates in Phaedrus claims that poetry is a divine inspiration, not a rational activity, and he is very favourable to divine madness, such as drinking, love and dreaming. In the dialogue of Ion, Socrates does not express his disapproval of Homer, as he does in the dialogue of the Republic. Instead, he regards Homer's Iliad as something like the Bible, a divinely inspired literary work, which provides moral guidance, depending on how you interpret it. But in the dialogue of the Republic, he advocates the prohibition of Homer's poetry and laughter, which shows his complex relationship with art. Plato also recognizes that tragedy, comedy, epic poetry, and dance are different, but the function of art is the same. Aristotle has also studied art, and has classified the various literary and musical forms.", "sample_id": 33}
{"x": "The earliest known artistic achievement in Europe is the Riesebrscheschildknochen from the Einhorn-Höhle, which is about 51,000 years old and attributed to the Neanderthals. In the caves of South Africa, tiny snail shells have been found that have been drilled for the sake of having a place for paints; they go back to the olden times of a hundred thousand years. The first sculptures and other finds of a comparable date, such as the Venus of Hohl Fels, were found in the World Heritage of the Caves and Ice-Age Art in the Swabian Jura. But the significance of these works is still debated because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. But many of the founding traditions of art can be traced back to the art of various ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Greece. It is a key site for the production of art because it contains the oldest known mobile works of human art, carved humanoid figurines, as well as the oldest known musical instruments. It goes back to 43,000 to 35,000 B.C.", "sample_id": 34}
{"x": "The Greek period of art shows a very strong emphases on the human form, and the development of techniques which portray it in its full beauty, power and proportions. The long-lasting and widespread influence of ancient civilizations has meant that many of their works have survived, and their artistic techniques have been transmitted to later civilizations, and in particular, many of the ancient civilizations have left the earliest records of the methods used by artists. The art of the Middle Ages, dominated by biblical and religious subjects, also used styles intended to represent the divine, using for example a gold background to painted images and glass in mosaics and stained-glass windows. These art forms were the foundations of all later artistic works. However, Byzantine art continued to have a classical realism in its smaller works, and realism began to dominate in Catholic art. There were a number of artistic styles in this period, including realism and imitating nature, and a gradual move towards realism in art. The basic form of the figures was usually idealized, with flat faces. In the east, the Islamic art movement was characterized by the elimination of iconography, focusing on geometric forms, calligraphy, and architectural forms. Religious subjects continued to dominate in the east, as did the religious values of the period. Artists began to emphasize the corporeality of the human body, and began to develop the method of graphical perspective, which was a new, more naturalistic method of portraying depth in three-dimensional space.", "sample_id": 35}
{"x": "For instance, comedy is the imitation of characters who are a little inferior to average, tragedy of those who are slightly superior. The different types of art are characterized by the subject of their imitation and the mode of representation. The true sense of the word art, in its connection with the fine arts, took shape in the seventeenth century. It is commonly defined as the artistic skill which expresses the artist’s creativity, engages the spectator’s aesthetic sensibility, and encourages reflection on higher forms of art. Aristotle said that imitation is a natural characteristic of the human nature and constitutes its difference from other animals. The word art may be used in several different senses, each connected to the others: I. The study of the creative art. II. The practice of the creative art. III. The result of the creative art. IV. The power of the creative art. V. The ennoblement of the creative art. The creative art, as a branch of learning, embraces a number of different branches which produce works of art (art as object), proceed from personal expression (art as activity), and convey ideas, emotions, or symbolism (art as experience). I. The result of the creative art. II. The power of the creative art. III. The result of the creative art. IV. The spectator’s experience of the creative art. V. The ennoblement of the creative art.", "sample_id": 36}
{"x": "The famous German philosopher, Martin Heidegger, thinks that art is a vehicle not only of truth in culture, but is itself a vehicle for the creation of truth. In his epochal work The Origin of the Work of Art, he links the two words “being” and “truth” and shows how they might be connected. Through the centuries, there have been many instances in which the dissemination of artistic knowledge and ideas has been brought about through the trade routes. Every new work of art, each new creative talent, enters a culture and influences the general understanding of that culture. This artistic exchange has had a profound influence on artistic creation. One of the most obvious examples is the Silk Road, where the Hellenic, Indian, and Chinese influences all came together. Greek-Buddhist art is a good example. Art is often classified according to forms, genres, media, and styles, usually based on perceptual criteria. Trieste was a multicultural seaport in early twentieth-century Europe, and James Joyce and other writers from central Europe came together there. The same was true of New York City, which became known as a cultural melting pot and a center of artistic innovation. Art is categorized in order to understand and appreciate it.", "sample_id": 37}
{"x": "On the other hand, the increased world contacts of this period led to the cross-pollination of artistic ideas and influences. It was in the latter half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century that the world became aware of Impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism and Surrealism. However, the limits of these movements cannot be defined beyond their inception. Oppositely, the Western world’s artistic influences on Asian artistic trends during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were equally significant. In this regard, Japanese woodcuts, which were greatly influenced by Renaissance art, were deeply influential on the birth of Impressionism and its succeeding movements. Then again, African sculptures were to some extent a source of inspiration for Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Although Modernism, with its uncompromising insistence on the veracity of truth, began to decline towards the latter half of the twentieth century, a number of art theorists, most notably Theodor W. Adorno, expressed it in this way: “It is now considered taken for granted that art can take nothing for granted, neither art itself, nor its place in the world, nor even the right of art to exist.” Likewise, the theories of Communism and Postmodernism originating in the West had a significant influence on the eastern world’s artistic practices. The acceptance of a relative view of art is an essential feature of postmodernism.", "sample_id": 38}
{"x": "However, a different point of view also emerges when it comes to interpreting the arts. Philosophers often object to the extreme intentionality of the arts, which views intention as the prime thing in understanding the art. In fact, it is not uncommon for art to possess many meanings, and the artist’s intention is not always clear or irrelevant. Thus, post-structuralism views art in the context of society and culture, and seeks to explain the significance of the work of art from the vantage point of its social context, rather than focusing on the artist’s intention and the forms he uses. It is argued that “this interpretation is socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal and politically inappropriate”. Art criticism thus develops in tandem with artistic practice. In fact, it may be historical and material conditions which take precedence in some cases. Art is the expression of emotions, thoughts and observations. By ‘art’ we may mean skill, craftsmanship and an innate ability to work with materials; or the use of language to express ideas directly and profoundly. If the artist’s skills, craftsmanship and mastery of materials are deep, he will probably possess a good grasp of his own ideas.", "sample_id": 39}
{"x": "Philosophical studies of art can be divided into three principal branches, formalism, content analysis and context analysis. Artistic analysis includes the artistic methods of the painter, the formal structure of his work and his methods, concentrating on the non-semantic elements of colour, form, size, texture, tone, balance, harmony, rhythm and proportion, with a view to a harmonious fusion of all these. It is a synthesis of form and content. The field of study of the contents of works of art is not settled. The term subject matter or content, with its connotations and denotations, is used by some, while others use terms such as meaning or significance.", "sample_id": 40}
{"x": "Rembrandt, now celebrated for his ephemeral qualities, was in his own time chiefly appreciated for his technical mastery. Skill in execution has been considered a necessary element of art, and one which insures its success. Presently a commonplace of criticism is the lack of skill and competence that characterized certain modern art forms. At the beginning of the twentieth century John Singer Sargent’s technique was the subject of admiration and criticism, at the same time as Pablo Picasso, a man who was later to be a leading figure in the new art, was doing brilliantly in the old school. And later in the century, with the advent of the mass media, Tracey Emin’s My Bed and Damien Hirst’s The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, challenge the very notion of competence as such.", "sample_id": 41}
{"x": "From the innate ability, individuals slowly develop their special talents, and eventually produce their own verse by the process of improvising. Imitation is an inherent instinct in man, and according to Aristotle, harmony and rhythm are natural tendencies of the soul, with metre being a particular part of rhythm. Albert Einstein regarded the mystery as the most profound element of human experience, and considered that the study of the unknown is the beginning of both art and science. Art, poetry and music provide a means of exploring our relationship with the universe, and this process occurs largely unconsciously, spontaneously and instinctively. For example, the eagle of Jupiter has no logic, but it is an image of great majesty, which inspires the imagination, and stimulates it into a whole series of ideas, which are incomprehensible through the medium of language. Art and literature are not limited by the sequence and the meaning of words, and unlike words, art is a free association of symbols, signs and ideas.", "sample_id": 42}
{"x": "In contemporary art the means of production often involves the assemblage of found objects, a procedure that is typical of the newer types of art. Damien Hirst is known for the way he puts together his artworks. The execution of most of his pieces is entrusted to a skilled workman. This way of working makes it difficult to define art’s purpose, which is markedly different at different times. This does not mean that art’s purpose is ambiguous, but merely reflects the diversity of reasons for creating art. In spite of this, however, numerous modern and contemporary artists continue to create works that are the products of traditional art, such as drawing and painting. Art is regarded in this context as a basic aspect of human nature, as no other species creates art. Art’s functions can be classified into two main groups: unintentional and intentional. Unintentional functions are those that are intrinsic to the human condition, regardless of the individual’s intentions, and which do not serve some extraneous purpose. A person’s instinct for harmony, balance and rhythm is a prime example of this. Art’s function is therefore one that is independent of the utilitarian purpose it might serve.", "sample_id": 43}
{"x": "A considerable part of art, anthropologists tell us, has no purpose in nature; it is in the nature of all the expressions of a people. Such a culture usually has a cosmological basis and gives expression to its relation to its natural environment. The arts, of which there are countless varieties, play a considerable part in the various ceremonial dances and ceremonies, by decorating them and by the symbolic significance which they have for the people of the country. These uses of art have a deliberate and conscious purpose in the sense that they were created with the intention of the artist or creator. Scholars who study prehistoric objects which are without a utilitarian purpose are accustomed to classify them as decorative, ritual or symbolical. This leads to difficulties in the interpretation of the term art. Art, in its most elementary form, is a form of communication, and like other forms of communication, it usually has a goal or intention that it is directed towards an audience, which is to say that it has a deliberate purpose. These purposes can include, for example, advocating political change, addressing a social problem, expressing a mood or feeling, communicating psychological experiences, illustrating certain theoretical ideas, promoting commercial products or serving as a means of communication.", "sample_id": 44}
{"x": "The Diagnosis Drawings series is a psychotherapeutic tool used in the clinical assessment of personality and emotional functioning. The art work produced during the DDS procedure is not its primary objective, but the therapeutic process that is fostered by the artistic experience. Commercial art, on the other hand, attempts to evoke specific emotional responses that guide the viewer’s behavior toward the products and ideas it represents. Art has long been used as a tool for propaganda, subtly influencing public opinion and perceptions. The field of evolutionary psychology has explored the hypothesis that artistic creativity and expression serve a similar function to the peacock’s tail, a showy display that functions as a sexual signal to potential mates, and has proposed that these traits have evolved to enhance reproductive success. The ability of the human brain to produce artistic expression has often been considered a surplus of the requirements of survival in our ancestral environment.", "sample_id": 45}
{"x": "Art is not only a vehicle of personal expression, but also serves as a medium for others to appreciate and recognize its value. Research indicates that a significant number of visual arts students believe that reflection is an important part of the artistic process. Art education journals emphasize that reflection is integral to the overall experience of creating and experiencing art. Art, as a way of communication, can evoke many different emotions, based on the beauty of the work. Art is a valuable part of the life of the nation, not only in providing knowledge but in promoting general well-being. In our present society, art has become a vital social phenomenon, and although we may sometimes argue about the value of art and the extent of its success, it is clear that its meaning goes well beyond the realm of mere commercialism. Art, from the ancient time, has often been associated with the affluent and powerful. Many of the works created for kings and princes, for example, are executed on a grand scale and use expensive materials. These works are not for the masses; they are for the wealthy, those with financial power. Besides, many art works are created for practical purposes, to encourage analysis and reflection among the public. Hence, the significance of art is not restricted to a particular period of time or to a specific culture. On the other hand, it has been available to the common people, for a number of centuries, in many different forms. This has been especially true of pottery, which has been created to last, as well as textiles and wood carving.", "sample_id": 46}
{"x": "During the French Revolution the Louvre Museum was established, and with it the transfer to the State of the property of the royal collections. Likewise, before the French Revolution, there was founded in Madrid a gallery to house part of the Royal Art Treasures. Similar Royal Art Galleries, open to the public, were established in Vienna and Munich. The establishment of the public museums, and the art education of the school children, was almost the result of the need to bring art to the people. The Museum was not only to afford them access to art, but to influence the audience’s appreciation of it. This development was, however, only part of a general movement already underway. In America many museums were founded by affluent private individuals, as a gift to the public. For example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York was founded by John Taylor Johnston, a railroad executive, whose private collection was the foundation of the Museum. Research demonstrates that these museums play a significant role in the formation of modern art appreciation.", "sample_id": 47}
{"x": "Unlike the political art, the social art, the social analysis, or the anarchistic art, the questioning art, has no more political aims than to stimulate thought. Various forms of this art have been known, such as the graffito, or street art, or the vandalism of public buildings, walls, buildings, omnibuses, railway trains, and bridges. Art has constituted a precious means of arousing the idea of numerous social problems. Numerous artistic actions have been devoted to such causes as the evils of child labour, cancer, the traffic of persons, the preservation of the oceans, the wars in Darfur, the abominations of the Aborigines, the abuses of the old people, and the pollution. But if this art is a great means of social protest, it is also, when it is an act of vandalism, a criminal act. Art has also been recognized as a psychological cure, and a means of helping the sick. A good example of this is the “trashion,” or the fashion reconstructed from waste materials, as exemplified by Marina Debris. Through the creative work, individuals explore their feelings, face up to difficulties, and find an outlet for their emotions, which in turn helps them to find peace of mind. In therapeutic situations, various forms of art are used to support the mental health of the patients, encourage emotional expression, and aid personal growth.", "sample_id": 48}
{"x": "The creative process can be divided into several stages, although there is no universal agreement on the exact number. The functions of art are not mutually exclusive, and overlap in many respects. An artwork created for entertainment may also be used for commercial purposes, for example, to promote a movie or a game. In the first stage, the artist first sees his artwork in his mind’s eye, and sets off on the road towards its realization. This section deals with three general stages, preparation, creation, and reflection. The second stage is the actual creation of the artwork. Preparation can also involve research into the subject matter, as well as gathering material for the artist’s inspiration. Artistic inspiration may come from instinct, impressions, and emotions. For example, Goya’s late works, which are somber in tone, may be the result of the artist’s experiences during the Napoleonic Wars, or his personal isolation. These paintings were executed directly on the walls of his home in Spain, and it is said that he never showed them to anyone. The emotional state of the artist, his environment, and his mental state can all have an effect on the creative process. Trial and error often play an important part in the creative process, allowing the artist to explore his ideas. Members of the group The Beatles have claimed that substances such as LSD and hashish played a part in the creation of songs for their album Revolver.", "sample_id": 49}
{"x": "But not only temples, but many of the palaces, mansions, and other establishments of the wealthy, afforded public access to certain parts of the premises. The Egyptian temples, as a rule, are remarkable for the grand and rich ornamentation which is confined to the parts of the temple accessible to the public, and by the opposite contrast between the austere part reserved for the priests, which was less open to the common people. Now in these same establishments the public was often allowed to inspect royal or private collections. Often there was a dress-regulation which was maintained, as at Versailles, where the dresses, shoes, buckles, and swords were all provided for a small fee. In Italy, especially in the time of the Grand Tour, art-touring became a flourishing industry, and the governments and towns of the country promoted the viewing of their art treasures, as a means of adding to the tourist’s cultural experience. For instance, the Orleans’ collection, mainly contained in a part of the Palais Royal in Paris, was open to the public for many years during the eighteenth century.", "sample_id": 50}
{"x": "According to Steve Mithen, art consists of symbols, works, and images imbued with meaning and enabling communication. Art is meant to arouse certain emotions, for entertainment or relaxation of the viewer. Art serves as a medium for communication, not only conveying scientific ideas, but also moods, emotions, and feelings. The avant-garde of Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, which formed a whole in the 20th century, sought to criticize society and its conventions by means of visual imagery. This is especially true of the art industry, including film and video games, where the main goal is to amuse the audience. Bereton, the father of Surrealism, was an opponent of this attitude, saying it was the cause of mediocrity and a hindrance to art and science. He argued that it is this attitude which enables a culture which seeks to cater to the lowest common denominator, thereby killing creativity and innovation. Realistic thinking, which comes from the Catholic Church, from Saint Thomas Aquinas, and from Anatole France, was criticized for its supposed hostility to spiritual and moral progress. There is a kind of liberty which allows art to be uncensored and the exploration of ideas, which is why art is seen as a “free zone.”", "sample_id": 51}
{"x": "From the cylinder seals, which were not only beautiful but also practical, a class of middle class developed in the East. When coinage was introduced, coins were art which spread over all classes. The method of reproduction, of molds, permitted the general diffusion of highly artistic pieces of Roman pottery, and Greek Tanagra figurines. At first the books were dear, but their price gradually decreased, and at the beginning of the nineteenth century they were within reach of the poorest classes. A great novelty took place in Europe in the fifteenth century, when woodcuts were made, largely religious, of a small size, and sold at low prices, which even the poor could afford to paste on their walls. It was the people of Basel who, in 1661, created the first public museum of art in the world, the Kunstmuseum Basel, whose collection extends from the beginning of the fifteenth century to the present day. For centuries, popular prints of various kinds have adorned the interiors and public spaces of homes. The Kunstmuseum Basel has in its collection, in addition to the universal masterpieces which he houses, a collection of masterpieces which have become especially famous throughout the world. The collection of paintings, drawings and engravings of the Upper Rhine from 1400 to 1600, of 19th and 20th century art, is well-known, because of the art and the writers of the area.", "sample_id": 52}
{"x": "In the years around 1970 a great deal of artistic effort went into making art that transcended the usual purchasing and selling; Joseph Beuys, one of the most important German artists of the post-war period, declared in this regard: ‘It is necessary to do more than merely make things.’1 Throughout history, artists have sought to create works that cannot be bought by the wealthy as mere ornaments. It was this wish to avoid commodification of art that led to aesthetic innovation in the mid-1960s, and continued to flourish into the 1970s. This period saw the emergence of various forms of art: performance art, conceptual art, video art. The basic idea was that, since these works were either performances or ideas, they could not be owned as objects. However, in the decades since, these artistic movements have been somewhat eclipsed by the fact that these unconventional forms have become the subject of market-driven commodification: if not merely a product, then at least a form of commercialization. It is hard to deny that the intention of the Conceptual artists was to replace the material object with a performance or a publication, in the hope of ending the view of art as a mere commodity. In the event, however, the latter development has posed questions about the underlying relationship between artistic intention and the art market.", "sample_id": 53}
{"x": "The advent of DVD recording gave the artist and the gallery a significant new tool to manage the distribution of works of digital art. In contemporary art, status has moved from ownership to understanding. This suggests that a society where art is important is becoming more aristocratic. Art has always been controversial, for a variety of reasons. Many of the arguments are poorly documented or have been lost. The new technology makes it possible to sell limited editions of the work to collectors, and thereby increases the control of the artist. Artistic conventions are conservative and strictly enforced, though the public response is variable. The content of images can also cause controversy, as in late-medieval images of the Virgin making love to Jesus while he was being crucified. Art has also been criticised for depicting unpopular individuals, political parties, or groups.", "sample_id": 54}
{"x": "With the advent of Romanticism and the transformations in the economic system of art, the determining principle of artistic content has increasingly been the artist's personal vision. This has led to a great increase in controversies around works of art, the importance of which varies. An entire century has been spent in artistic controversy, an evolution which shows the constant dialogue between artists and social demands, and which demonstrates the complex relationship between art, culture, and the public. The artists were pressed by the need to stand out and to be noticed, and so often pushed themselves into controversial topics.", "sample_id": 55}
{"x": "Gaut and Livingston distinguish between two critical theories, intentionalism and formalism. The intentionalists claim that a knowledge of the intentions of the creator is necessary for the correct interpretation of the work; the formalists, on the contrary, claim that the work must be analyzed independently of the creator. The creation of a work of art, although interesting, does not necessarily constitute the right interpretation. In the later twentieth century, a large debate arose, called the linguistic turn, or the innocent eye controversy, in the philosophy of art. Richard Wollheim expresses this conception in these words: The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, whereby the creative process must not be conceived as preceding but as following the work of art. Thus it becomes evident that the meaning of the work is related to the intentions of the creator. This controversy, which involves the relationship between language, interpretation, and perception, complicates the debate between intentionalism and formalism.", "sample_id": 56}
{"x": "It was a preparatory movement, preparing the ground for later generations of artists in the eighties, nineties and noughties who extended this critical self-reference to a wider range of images in popular culture—not only art, but also fashion, comics, billboards, pornography. Pop art became a recognizable phenomenon of the second half of the twentieth century, and figures such as Andy Warhol gained widespread recognition for works that both praised and denounced mass culture and the art world. At the heart of this emergence lies a critique of the whole concept of art as such, and its distinction from other forms of creative expression. In his book The Invention of Art: A Cultural History,1 the author examines the evolution of the art system in modern times, namely the criteria by which certain activities have been defined as art and the ways in which these definitions are based on social conventions. Such conventions, he argues, are historically constructed. The distinction between art and craft is a historical phenomenon that has developed only recently in human history. The author notes that ancient Greek society did not use the word ‘art’, but ‘techne’ to denote all skilled human activities, which included not only painting, sculpture and music, but also cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, divination and farming. The pop art movement, as well as its developments, can be seen as a kind of protest against the development of the art system, namely that it came into existence as a result of an arbitrary division in the middle of the seventeenth century, and only became widespread in the nineteenth century.", "sample_id": 57}
{"x": "The imputation of intention is a significant term of criticism that involves the question of how much the artist’s aesthetic intentions influence the critic’s judgment of his work. The New School has opened a considerable debate about the question of the intentional fallacy. In the seminal essay “The Intentional Fallacy,” published in 1946, Wimsatt and Beardsley argued that the intentional fallacy was a form of the problem of the validity of the imputation of intention, that the intentional fallacy is the basic principle for the analysis of literary works and that it is the primary source of meaning, while the intentions of the author can be a mere distraction, a diversion, or an irrelevant obtrusiveness. This view was later disputed by theorists of the reader school of literary criticism. In conjunction with this essay, Wimsatt and Beardsley wrote another essay, “The Affective Fallacy,” in which they discussed the role of the reader’s personal and emotional reactions in the analysis of literature, arguing that such reactions cannot be taken into account in a critical judgment of the work. The debate about the intentional fallacy and affective fallacy continues to influence literary criticism and theory to this day, and there is no better proof of this than the essay by a leader of the reader school, namely, the New School’s Stanley Fish, who in 1970 criticized Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay “Literature in the Reader.”", "sample_id": 58}

This investigation is based on the recurrent use of texts by philosophers and theorists, especially Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars like Ernst Gombrich and Nelson Goodman, in The Languages of Art, An Approach to a Theory of Symbols,2 showed that the conceptuality of art takes precedence over the visual experience of it; this shift has had long-term consequences for the study of art and its interpretation in the broader framework of the humanities. In this perspective, the fact that language is not a neutral medium in which thought is poured is strongly asserted, which has also been emphasized by the philosophers Johann Georg Hamann and Wilhelm von Humboldt.", "sample_id": 59}
