{"x": "A given economy is a collection of processes which have as principal elements its culture, its education, its technological evolution, its history, its social organization, its political organization, its legal system, and its natural resources. An economy is a field for the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. In general, it is a social realm in which are concentrated the practices, the discourses, and the material signs referring to the use, use, and management of resources. It is thus a social realm where the relations between men and men are interwoven, and where nothing exists isolated. Individuals, companies, organizations, governments, all these are economic agents, which furnish the context, the content, and the conditions of operation. Activity is based on the use of natural resources, labor, and capital. Economic relations are accomplished by the binding of two persons, two groups, two lots, according to the value or price of the object of the exchange, generally expressed in a certain currency. But monetary relations only constitute a small part of the economic sphere. This sphere has undergone successive changes resulting from technical evolutions, the creation of new products, new services, new processes, an enlargement of the market, diversification of markets, specialization, increase in revenues, the substitution of child labor by universal instruction, and from various industrial relations.", "sample_id": 0}
{"x": "The most common meaning of the word today, namely the economic system of a country or a region, seems not to have appeared until the 1650s. The Latin word comes from the Greek oikonomia or oikonomos; the first half of the word, oikos, signifies 'house', and the second, nemein, signifies 'to manage'. The Sumerians developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money, while the Babylonians and their neighboring city states developed the first economic systems in the form of debt law, contract law, and commercial law. The Babylonians and their neighboring city states developed the first economic systems, in the sense of laws and debts, laws of contract, and laws of commercial practice. History As long as people have made, supplied, and distributed goods and services, there has been some kind of economy; economies have grown larger as societies have grown larger and more complex. The ancient economy was mostly based on farming, and the Shekel was the first currency in the world, a unit of measurement and weight used by the Semites. They developed the first standardized systems of law and administration, with courts, prisons and public registers. The term economy has been used in Mesopotamia since about 3000 BC.", "sample_id": 1}
{"x": "Some traders, however, traded in the market-places. The exchange of goods had been chiefly through social relations. The shekel had been at first both a unit of money and a unit of weight, just as the English pound was at first a unit which meant a pound of silver. The great cycle of institution-building in the China of the ancients had been based upon an idea. In ancient Greece, from which the present English word “economy” derives, many people were slaves of the freeholders. The argument was prompted by the question of scarcity. In the Middle Ages, what we now call “economy” had been close to subsistence level; most exchanges were between the members of a social group. The interests of a non-market economy were best served by the legal protection of tenures and the exclusion of bureaucratic opportunities. As to the great conquests, they had been financed by what we now call “venture capital” (ventura, Italian, “risk”), capital which would be paid back by the goods they brought back from the New World. The first enterprises had been mercantile. In 1513 the first stock exchange was set up in Antwerp. The discoveries of Marco Polo (1254-1324), Christopher Columbus (1451-1506), Vasco da Gama (1469-1524) had made possible the first international economy. The European conquests had become the branches of European states, the so-called colonies. At this time, the word “economy” meant mainly trade.", "sample_id": 2}
{"x": "Europe’s period of secularization made it possible for states to use the immense wealth of the Church to promote the development of cities. France, Great Britain and the Dutch Republic attempted to control trade by imposing taxes on imports and exports, and mercantilism (from mercator, a Latin word meaning merchant) was the first attempt to reconcile private wealth with public interests. It was a time when bankers like Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1769–1855) began to finance national endeavours like wars and public works. The influence of the aristocracy diminished. The first ministers of finance began to operate. Physiocracy, a reaction against mercantilism, inspired Adam Smith, a Scottish thinker of 1723–1790, to formulate the principles of a national economy: products offered at their natural price, determined by the forces of competition – supply and demand – and the division of labour. From then on, ‘economics’ meant the national economy, in the sense of the economic activities of the citizens of a nation-state. The Industrial Revolution and the Technological Revolution. And Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) extended the principle of supply and demand to the question of overpopulation. He asserted that the driving force behind free trade is human self-interest. The so-called ‘economic man’ became the anthropological basis for national economy.", "sample_id": 3}
{"x": "This period is known as the Industrial Revolution, because of the development of machinery and division of labour, which enabled the mass production of goods. In Europe, the system of mercantilism was gradually replaced by a system of wild capitalism, which led to an expansion of industry. This era was a major turning point in human history, affecting almost every aspect of daily life. After the turmoil of two world wars and the devastating Great Depression, policymakers sought a new approach to managing the economy. Friedrich August von Hayek (1899–1992) and Milton Friedman (1912–2006) both advocated free trade on a global scale and are often credited with being the originators of neoliberal economics. The notion of the economy as a single unified entity as we understand it today became common only after the Great Depression of the 1930s. In honour of John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), economists speak of the theory that the state can be used to alleviate economic problems and stimulate economic growth by regulating the level of aggregate demand. However, the majority view was that of the interventionist economist, John Maynard Keynes.", "sample_id": 4}

With the fall of the iron curtain and the transition of the socialist countries to democracy and market economies, the concept of an affluent society came into play, which should explain the significance that the service sector now has compared to the old industrialization. The development of the Internet as a medium of communication, especially in the years 2000-2001, has also created the concept of the Internet and information economy.

The preindustrial economy was largely based on subsistence farming, but the subsequent industrial revolution phase displaced subsistence farming with larger-scale, more monocultural agriculture over the past three centuries. The economy can be considered as having developed through the following phases, or degrees of priority: In the preindustrial economy, the primary economy was subsistence farming; the industrial revolution phase displaced subsistence farming with agriculture that was more intensive and was based on monocropping.

Conventional economic analysis of a country usually focuses on indicators such as GNP and GNP per capita.

The long-established terminology distinguishes indicators of an economy’s performance in terms of real values, such as real GNP, from nominal values, such as nominal GNP. The study of economics is roughly divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macroeconomics deals with the whole of the economy, in terms of regions and nations. Common areas of analysis include national income, production and income, employment, prices, international trade and other issues.

{"x": "G. Debreu introduced the concept in 1952. In theoretical economics, an abstract economy (also called a general N-person game) is a model that generalizes both the standard model of an exchange economy and the standard model of a game. An equilibrium of an abstract economy generalizes both a Walrasian equilibrium in microeconomics and a Nash equilibrium in game theory. Later, Shafer and Sun-nenschein re-explained the theorems in terms of preferences that were not transitive or complete. He called it the general N-person game, and proved that there is an equilibrium. Later, Arrow and Debreu (who renamed the concept the abstract economy) used this result to prove the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium in the Arrow-Debreu model. Debreu defined an abstract economy to consist of a finite number N of agents. For each agent i there is a choice set Xi (a subset of some Euclidean space Rl). This represents the agent's entire set of choices. A relation Ai: X  Xi represents the relation on the choices of agent i to the choices of all the other agents. The Cartesian product of the choice sets is defined as X=  j=1 N Xj.", "sample_id": 15}

{"x": "An exchange economy is a system of N-1 consumers and L homogeneous, divisible goods. Another way of weakening this is by saying that each utility function Ui is quasi-concave at xi, and Ui(xi,x) is lower semi-continuous, since Ui is Ui.

We define Y :=  j = 1 N Y j, that is, the Cartesian product of all the consumption sets: Y :=  j = 1 N Y j, that is, the set of all the possible ways of spending money. For each consumer i, there is a consumption set Y i (a subset of R l, displaystyle R_l ), which is the set of possible consumption bundles. Also, the consumer i has the following: i: the initial money w i in R + L, displaystyle w_iin R_l. Utility function V i : Y i  R, displaystyle V_i: Y_iR.

Arrow and Debreu offer the following reduction from the trading market to the market market. For an exchange market of N-1 agents, they define a N-agent market economy by adding a special agent called a \"player\" or \"market maker.\" If V i (z)> V i (y i), p z> p w i  p y i, i.e. , z> p y i p w i, w i z, and so on. The \"consumption\" of this special player is denoted by p.", "sample_id": 18}

The pricemaker has a set of preferences X N :=    (the set of possible prices), a utility function U N (y,p):= p  (sum yi - sum wi), U N (y,p)=p  (sum yi - sum wi) and an action set A N (y,p) . Intuitively, the pricemaker's choice of price adjusts supply and demand: for a commodity where supply exceeds demand, the right-hand side of U N (y,p) is negative, so the player chooses a low price, for a commodity where demand exceeds supply, the sign of U N (y,p) is positive and therefore he chooses a high price. The set of utility functions V i, V i is continuous and concave.", "sample_id": 19}
{"x": "Hence, for example, it suffices to suppose that no one is satisfied. The statement Ai(y,p)=  y i  Y i, where p y i  p w i, entails that the total expenditure of each agent does not exceed his budget. The statement Ui=Vi ensures that consumption for each agent is such as to give him maximum utility, given his budget. In our proof we assumed that Vi=y i but this assumption is not necessary: it would still hold if utility also depended on consumption of other agents (externalities), or on prices. Finally, the definition U n (y,p)= p  (  y i   w i ) ensures that total consumption is equal to total income. Therefore, if the economy in question satisfies these three conditions, there exists a competitive equilibrium. The general case: According to Shafer and Sonnenschein, for each agent i (i=1,...,n), there is: A feasible set X i (X i ) as before; a budgetary constraint A i (X  X i ) as before; a utility relation P i (X  X i ) as before.", "sample_id": 20}

The following conditions are sufficient for equilibrium in the generalized abstract economy: (a) each of the equilibria X i is compact, nonempty and convex. The equilibrium of Debreu is a special case of this equilibrium. The generalized equilibrium in the generalized abstract economy is a determinant x : for each i, the equilibria x i= A i (x i) : X i  X i (x i), and P i (x)A i (x)=, i.e. (b) each of the determinants A i (x)=A i (x) is nonempty and convex.

Note that the preference relation is not required to be complete or transitive. An equilibrium is defined as a combination of prices p and distributions y such that: the sum of all prices is 1; the sum of all distributions y i is at most the sum of initial endowments w i ; for each i, p  y i = p  w i, for each i: p  y i = p  w i, and for each z: if z  i y i then p  z  p  y i (i.e., p  y i  p  w i), otherwise:", "sample_id": 22}
{"x": "The assumption that the composite is infinite in the Mas-Collel setting is a proof that the existence of a competitive equilibrium in the generalized exchange economy is equivalent to the assumption that every pair of  i is relatively open (or equivalently, every P i has an open graph); for every bundle x, the set P i of x is convex and does not contain x (irreflexivity). Mas-Collel added the condition that the set P i of x is not empty (not equi-saturated). The  i   i shown in the above example, from the exchange economy of Arrow-Debreu to the abstract economy of Debreu, is valid for the generalized exchange economy of Mas-Collel. A negative example: an economy with two goods, say apples and bananas, if it has an open graph does not have to exist, if it does not have an open graph. For all i, w i = x i (for some bundle x, so that the initial appropriation is inside the sets of appropriations). There are two economic agents with identical endowments (w i = 1).", "sample_id": 23}
{"x": "However, this economy has no equilibrium. Let us assume that an equilibrium exists. Note that P(a,b) represents a complete and transitive relation, but it does not have a closed graph. If the price of bananas is zero, then both agents can have the combination (1,2), which is strictly better than their respective allocations. In this case, each agent must have the lexicographically best allocation, which is therefore (1,1). Then, in the second case, the price of bananas cannot be an equilibrium price. If the price of bananas is some p>0 (where the price of apples is one), then both agents can have the combination (1+p, 0), which is strictly better than their allocation. In both cases, the price cannot be an equilibrium price. Both results are wrong because the preferences are non-empty: P(yi)! P(yi) (non-saturation condition). The preferences are non-empty: P(yi)!

It is precisely because of the limitations of human capacity and information receptiveness that this phenomenon has a strong explanatory power. Something comes into our consciousness, we pay attention to a thing, and then decide whether to act. It is understood that if you can't find it, find it in another program, but it's in your application, you should use some attention economics, for example, you should have filters so that you can show me the most relevant, interesting, and personal information.

Erik Brynjolfsson, Seon-Tae Kim and Joo-Hee Oh argued that this makes it possible to formally analyze the attention economy, to put a price on what is a free good. A history of attention economy: The economist and psychologist Herbert A. Simon wrote in a study of scarce attention in an information society in 1971: “In an information-rich society, the wealth of information produces a scarcity of something else, the shortage of the resource that information consumes, and this shortage of resources creates a scarcity of attention, and we need to allocate it in an efficient manner between the abundance of sources that compete for this scarce resource.”", "sample_id": 27}

Attention to relationships with other people may be categorized as collective attention, i.e. collective sharing of information and knowledge. The new digital media and the Internet facilitate participation in this economy by providing new channels for distributing attention, such as those used to reach a wide audience when ordinary people publish content or comment on the content of others. In advertising ‘attention economics’ views a potential buyer’s attention as a resource.

Distinguished bankers, such as Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1774–1855), were in the habit of financing wars and promoting the development of the country. During the early modern period, France, Great Britain, and Holland regulated trade by the imposition of duties and the imposition of mercantilism. The Scotsman Adam Smith (1723–1790) is often regarded as the first modern economist. Physiocracy, which grew in reaction to mercantilism, influenced him and he wrote his basic principles of the national economy. Then came the Industrial Revolution, which was a turning point for the entire world. Supply and demand and the division of labor developed more. The economist Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) was a proponent of the principle of overpopulation, which derived from the laws of supply and demand. The impact of Malthus’s ideas was to further the understanding of economic growth in terms of the population.", "sample_id": 34}

The shekel was both a unit of money and a unit of weight, just as the English pound meant a pound of silver. In the Middle Ages, the economy was mostly characterized by subsistence production, and mainly between social groups. The discussion of economy during this period was largely influenced by the concept of scarcity. The Chinese economic law introduced the idea that a non-market economy can encourage institutional innovation, and the legal protection of firms can be legally protected. Through the explorations of Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama, the world economy has been developed. The notable thing about the economy is that the money to be used for the war is a form of risk capital, as in Italian “ventura”, the hope is that the profits from the newly discovered countries can be returned by the return on the investment. During this period, the economy is mainly trade, and European countries have established colonies as the extension of the country. Enterprises in this period were mainly commercial companies, and the stock exchange was established in Antwerp in 1513.", "sample_id": 35}

{"x": "MARKET ECONOMY: This economy is characterized by a dynamic and organized production and distribution of goods and services, where economic agents trade with each other through barter or through money, that is, currency. The economy can be divided into various types, depending on its structure and functioning. In a planned economy, the government or a few political agents control the production, distribution and cost of goods and services. The aim is to distribute the means of production in a planned way, not in a market. Prices in a market economy are determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers. The work in the gig economy is often short-term and flexible, and often provided through digital platforms. The green economy focuses on reducing the consumption of natural resources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing waste and energy consumption. The global economy is an interconnected economy of the world's countries. It represents the common and international economic activities and transactions of the nations. In the gig economy, employees often have only short-term tasks to do, rather than permanent and stable jobs. The development of the economy can be divided into several historical periods. In the unofficial economy, which the government does not control and does not tax, the scope of activities ranges from street vendors to non-registered businesses. It is very extensive and in many ways similar to the officially recognized economy. In ancient times, the economy was mainly based on self-sufficiency, and the community produced only what was necessary for its existence. These periods can be used to show the dynamic nature of the economy, which is adapted to the needs of society and technical development. During this time, mining, building and manufacturing industries also developed strongly, which played a key role in the last three centuries of economic development.", "sample_id": 37}
{"x": "In the modern sense the term real economy is usually employed by the experts and the administrators for that part of the economy that is concerned with the production of goods and services. In the analysis of a country's economy, many indicators are used, including the general budget, the per capita income, and the gross domestic product. Although these indicators are useful, it is important to note that GDP is a monetary measure that does not take into account economic activities that do not involve monetary transactions. An important distinction is made between real and nominal indicators, the former being those that take inflation into account (e.g., real GDP), and the latter those that are not. The real economy is contrasted with the paper economy, which is based on the financial sector and on the buying and selling of financial assets. The practical application of economic principles can be seen in the worlds of business, science, administration, and medicine, where the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services are common activities. The field of economics is generally divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics.

The Internet and the boom in new companies are linked to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early this century, a time when the value of the shares of Internet companies increased much more than those of well-established firms. Moreover, the use of financial instruments such as stock options was widespread in this period. Some companies were taken over by other companies and many of them went public at high valuations.

It contains a comprehensive analysis of the economic principles, with an emphasis on individual action and the role of human choice in the economy. The text is divided into several main parts, each of which treats a particular problem of economic theory. He discusses the market process, the role of prices, and the functions of capital. Starting with a survey of the nature of human action, Rothbard defines it as the intentional effort to achieve certain ends, and argues that the basic idea of economics is that of human choice. Continuing on the same topic, he argues against the government’s intervention in the economy, pointing out that the intervention usually leads to distortions and unwanted consequences. He points to the importance of private property and free trade as a basis for economic cooperation and development. 4. XII. XII. XIII. Man, Economy, and State is an important text in the history of economic thought and remains an important source of knowledge about the market process and the nature of human action.

Moreover, they are not denying that there is over-investment in information technology, but that productivity research indicates that many of these investments have actually contributed to the increase in output. They argue that a significant part of these investments will not bring the expected returns. In any case, the debates on the impact of information technology on economic theory are still going on, and it is obvious that the relationship between technological investment and the level of productivity is a very complex and multiple one. The economic crisis of 2001 contradicted the extreme predictions of economist Robert Gordon and the contribution of computers to productivity growth may have been overestimated.

In theoretical economy an abstract economy, or more correctly, a general game, is a model which integrates microeconomics and game theory, and this system covers the two in a more general form. The introductory concept was presented in 1952 by G. Debreu, who called it a generalized game, and proved the existence of an equilibrium, and later, he and his colleague Kenneth Arrow reformulated the concept of an abstract economy, and used the existence proof to prove the existence of the Walrasian equilibrium (competitive equilibrium) in the Arrow-Debreu model. The Arrow-Debreu model is a collection of a finite number N of agents, for each agent i the following is defined: i  Xi a set, where i  RN is a subset of some real ring, j  N. The cartesian product of the choice sets is defined as: ij=1  N  Xij.

{"x": "The problem of the market agent is to find a price which will bring together the supply and demand of the market. In the economics theory the agent is characterized by a decision set, denoted X_N =, representing the set of possible price combinations, and a utility function U_N(y,p)=p. (y-w-i) where y is the number of units of goods consumed, p-price, and w-goods endowed. If the exchange economy is to achieve equilibrium, it is necessary that certain conditions be fulfilled. If supply exceeds demand, then the right-hand side of the utility function U_N(y,p) becomes negative, and the agent tries to lower the price, and if demand exceeds supply, then the right-hand side of the utility function U_N(y,p) becomes positive, and the agent tries to raise the price. The conditions imposed guarantee that the abstract economy will be at equilibrium. The consumption set Y_i should be closed and convex, with w_i in the interior, and the utility function U_i should be continuous and concave.", "sample_id": 46}

Moreover, the use of the expenditure limit (U i = V i) ensures that consumption is used to optimize utility within the budget. Shafer and Sun-dschein built up their model in the following way: For each agent i there are: (i = 1, 2,..., n - 1), the budget, and (i, 2), the budget plus the expected value. It should be noted that, although the first step of the proof relies on the assumption that V i is dependent on y_i alone, this assumption is not strictly necessary. Even if V i is affected by the consumption of other agents (externalities), or by the prices that exist, the proof is still valid.

{"x": "The model proposed by Debreu is a special case of generalized abstract economies. In it, preference correspondences are defined by means of the utility function, as follows: P_i(x): z_i in X_i; U_i(z_i, x_i) > U_i(x_i, x_-i). In this formula, z_i is the set of the alternatives which the agent i prefers to the chosen object x_i in the presence of the choice of other agents x_i. The equilibrium is defined as a choice x = (x_1, x_2,..., x_n), for which, for each agent i, the conditions are satisfied: (x_i  A_i(x)) and (x_i  U_i(x_i)) — that is, this choice satisfies two properties: transitivity, and the unsatisfied preferences of the agents, who have not chosen x_i. The concept of equilibrium, proposed by Debreu, is a special case of the generalized concept of equilibrium. For the existence of the equilibrium of a generalized abstract economy, the following two conditions are sufficient to assure the existence of equilibrium: P_i(x)  P_i(x) = emptyset. Each agent's choice lies in the set of the possibilities, to which he has no preference. Each preference correspondence A_i is continuous. Each set of choices X_i is compact, non-empty and convex.

{"x": "According to Matthew Crawford, \"Attention is a scarce resource. The amount of it a person has is finite. \" Attention economics is a way of describing information management that sees human attention as a scarce resource. It makes use of economics to solve various information problems. In this context, the individual receives a variety of information, selects some of it to pay attention to, and then decides whether to take action based on this information. It has been defined by Thomas H. Davenport and John C. Beck as the focused engagement of mental resources on a particular piece of information. Selective attention allows the individual to extract from the environment only what is necessary and to ignore what is not necessary. In practical applications, the attention economy concept is often incorporated into the design of a software graphical user interface. The ability to process information is limited, so an individual can only pay attention to a certain amount of data at the same time. It is therefore advisable for the software to present the most relevant data to the individual, based on the behavior and interests of the individual, and to ensure that the content is engaging, in order to optimize the attention of the individual. This is based on the fact that if the user does not find what he is looking for, he will turn to other applications.", "sample_id": 53}

Hence the possibility of indifference and the failure to choose. In a word, the principles of compensated equilibrium and Pareto efficiency are the fundamental means of analysing individual preferences and of achieving the most efficient allocation of resources in the economy. A Pareto-optimal solution is a solution in which no one is made worse by it, and a Pareto-improvement is a solution in which a group of individuals (J) are made strictly better off by an alternative bundle y'than they are by Y i, while leaving the distributions for all the other individuals unchanged.

Simon’s characterization of the overload of information as a problem of economy has gained currency in information-processing discussions since the middle of the nineties. Thomas H.

Kevin Kelly, a leading digitalist, pointed out in 2008 that the attention economy of today increasingly includes digital products that reproduce almost without cost. Information-systems scholars have also incorporated the concept and are exploring the problem of establishing property rights in attention, with the intention of solving the problems of the attention economy, which affect both consumers and producers.

{"x": "In general terms, this reduction implies that certain conditions are sufficient for the existence of a competitive equilibrium in the generalized market economy. This reduction traces a transition from the Arrow–Debreu market economy to Debreu’s abstract economy, and it can also be applied to Mas–Colell’s generalized exchange economy, and to Shafer–Sonnenschein’s generalized abstract economy. For each bundle x, P_i[x] is convex and does not contain x itself. That is, the preference relation prec_i is relatively open. That is equivalent to saying that each preference relation P_i[x] has an open structure. 3. Mas–Colell introduced the additional condition that the set P_i[x] is not empty, which ensures non-saturation. To give an example of the occurrence of a situation where the open structure is not satisfied, we have an economy with two goods, apples and bananas, for example. Suppose there are two homogeneous agents, with initial endowments of one unit of each good, so that there is no preference relation between w_i and x_i. That is, w_i is the strictly preferred endowment of x_i, which means that w_i is in the interior of the preference relation. If that is the case, the competitive equilibrium of the market is not stable.", "sample_id": 56}
{"x": "With the coming of the new media, and especially the internet, new routes for the distribution of attention have been created. Long-term attention is the sustained focus that we allocate to the relationship that we have with others. An excessive attention to these relationships can result in “social interaction overload”, where the maintenance of social relations becomes too much, especially in the context of social networks where it is easy to be overwhelmed by solicitations. In the realm of advertising, attention economics has become a thing, and consumers’ attention is considered to be a valuable commodity. People can now produce and distribute their own content, as well as consuming the content of others. This has also given rise to the concept of collective attention, which tries to explain how attention for new phenomena spreads across a population and subsequently fades away. Traditionally, the model that has been used by advertisers in the old mass media has been called AIDA, which stands for “attention, interest, desire and action”.", "sample_id": 57}
{"x": "For the sake of clarity, let us suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that equilibrium exists. In economic theory, Pi x a x b is a transitive complete relation, and thus a complete one, but it should be pointed out that this relation is not a complete one. In other words, there is no equilibrium. Both cases can be described: 1. Each agent's distribution must be at least lexically with (1, 1), which implies that both agents' distribution must be exactly with (1, 1). 2. If we denote the price of apples as p, the price of bananas as p (with apples set to 1), then each of them can afford a bundle of (1 + p, 0). If the price of bananas is zero, then both agents can afford a bundle of (1, 1), which is much more advantageous than the one they have already. The research carried out by Fon and Otani extended the equilibrium results of Mas-Colell to the generalized economic exchanges that Fon and Otani considered. This is also strictly better than their distribution of (1, 1). So in both cases the proposed price cannot be an equilibrium price. This result is crucial for applying welfare results to generalized exchange economies. Their analysis is based on a few assumptions: - Y i is not empty, convex, closed, and lower-bound limited. - PI y emptyset emptyset. This condition corresponds to the non-saturation condition.", "sample_id": 58}
{"x": "This phenomenon, which is known as “overloading”, is able to compromise decision-making, since consumers will continue to seek out and compare products out of a desire to obtain greater benefit than the cost of doing so. As the cost of transmitting advertisements to consumers has greatly decreased, particularly through the Internet, it has become possible to overwhelm the consumers with more advertisements than they can actually process, and thus the attention of consumers has become a limited resource, which must be allocated carefully. To deal with the challenges of overload, it has been suggested that it might be possible to consider the overload, the advertising and the spam, as a sort of pollution or “unfavourable externality”. When critics speak of advertising which draws attention to itself without the consent or compensation of the consumer, they argue that this is a kind of theft, and thus also have a moral dimension. It has also been suggested that the market could be a way to cope with the problem. A market-based solution to dealing with externalities was proposed by the economist Ronald Coase in his influential article “The Problem of Social Cost” in 1960. Externalities are the consequences of an economic activity which have an effect on third parties who are not directly involved in the activity, air and water pollution being good examples of negative externalities, which impose costs on society and the environment. By applying the same principle to the exploitation of the overloading consumers, it might be possible to arrive at a solution which would be beneficial to both consumers and companies. This idea is derived from Coase’s earlier article on the Federal Communications Commission in which he argues that radio frequency interference is an externality which can be prevented by the introduction of property rights.", "sample_id": 59}
