{"x": "martin Simon's characterization of information overload as an economic issue has gained prominence in the culture of information consumption of the mid-1990s. Influential writers such as Thomas k. jefferson and charles martin introduced names like \"focus economy\" and \"concept of information\" to describe this phenomenon. Some theorists say that \"attention transactions\" may have financial transactions as the central focus of the economic system.\n\nauthors in information systems have also exploring this concept, exploring mechanism that could establish property dominance in marketing. another exploration aims to address the harm posed by the attention phenomenon and its problems for both consumer and environment.\n\nobject culture expert patrick Kelly notes that by 2008, the modern attention economy increasingly features consumer products that are nearly difficult to manufacture. today, the gain for suppliers is in adding valuable intangibles that will be ignored, thereby enhancing the overall brand of their brand.", "y": "gpt", "sample_id": 55}
{"x": "another \"market maker\" reduction described herein transitions from the market theorists of economists to the ecological economists of Debreu. a process can similarly be used to the traditional trade theorists of gdp and the generalized abstract economics of Shafer-Sonnenschein. \n\nanother explanation says that several things are applicable for the use of online economies with the generalized business definition:\n\n1. each equilibrium utility \\( \\prec_i \\) is relatively open, which is equal to stating that each preference ordering \\( P_i \\) has an independent graph.\n2. by another bundle \\( m \\), the utility \\( phi(x) \\) is symmetric and does not cross \\( phi \\) itself, demonstrating irreflexivity.\n3. Mas-Colell introduced an additional condition that the endowment \\( phi(v) \\) must be convex, indicates non-saturation.\n4. with each policy \\( i \\), the same endowment \\( w_i \\) is simply opened to some other \\( x_i \\) (pronounced as \\( w_i \\gg x_i \\)), saying that the initial endowment lives off the graph of the choice sets.\n\n\nto find the overall failure of policy existence when the internal graph property is not clear, is an apple comprising two agent, such as people and monkeys. for this scenario, there are two players with identical knowledge of (zero, one). this therefore gets the help of the closed graphs condition in defining competitive edge during the economy.", "y": "gpt", "sample_id": 56}
{"x": "insufficient focused response to the sustained resources will go to managing their engagement with agency. Excessive focus to these information can end in \"social interaction overload,\" a syndrome where persons get burden by the way of consumer solidarity, especially between the use of social communications people that need lower level of social solicitations.\n\nThe addition of digital media and the media has moved the emphasis of consumer motivation, providing new way for community attention. Individuals are now trying to reach broad extent by providing and using their own content, as well as connecting with the culture carried by brand. the problem has also extended to the point of collective marketing, which examines how interest to novel practices diminished and eventually rallied around mainstream organisations.\n\n\nIn the sense of demographics, the context of \"response economics\" treats consumer attention as a valuable resource. Traditional media advertisers have historically employed a view described as empathy, which asks for Attention, resources, empathy, and creativity. a model studies a linear process that people typically have when used with advertisements.", "y": "gpt", "sample_id": 57}
{"x": "in economic perspective, \\( [UNK](a_i, b_i) \\) imply a free and invariant economy. finally, it is nice to notice that this relation does not imply an obvious meaning, saying that the thing in question constitutes an economy.\n\nto take this concept further, let us imagine, for the law of equilibrium, that an equilibrium occurs. against this assumption, the terms for each agent need be lexicographically at alic \\( (1, 1) \\). this says that both agent price cannot be even \\( (1, 1) \\). \n\nTwo meanings start from this meaning:\n\none.    if the price of goods is set to one, both agents can get the bundle \\( (1, 2) \\), which is strictly faithful to their current price of \\( (1, 1) \\).\n\n2.    If the sale of goods is done as \\( t > one \\) (with the sale of apples set to one), both agent can have the tariff \\( (1 + p, 0) \\). every bundle is however very loyal than their tariff of \\( (1, 1) \\).\n\nIn both languages, the price relationship cannot implies an equilibrium price.\n\n\na critique conducted by ito and Otani gives the welfare theorems to the generalized exchange economy as proved by Mas-Colell. Their criticisms is centred on several key facts:\n\n- Each consumption situation \\( [UNK] \\) is open, loyal, secure, and discussed below.\n- The preference correspondence is non-empty, expressed as \\( o(y_i) \ni \\emptyset \\), which implying a certain behaviour.\n\nThese semantics are atic for the applications of welfare economists in the applications of generalized substitution economics.", "y": "gpt", "sample_id": 58}
{"x": "As the prevalence of transmitting advertisements to consumers has recently decreased, particularly through online channels, the ability to detect a greater volume of advertisements than consumers can initially respond has emerged. Consequently, consumer marketing has been a valuable investment that rewards careful selection. This interaction, often referred to as \"market confusion,\" can impede decision-making, as competitors may continue to search for and evaluate products, lured by the desires for greater opportunities than the costs incurred.\n\nCritics have raised concerns regarding advertisers who create attention-grabbing content that is sent to individuals without their permission or compensation. This action has been recognized as \"cyber theft,\" highlighting the complex implications of unsolicited advertising.\n\n\nOne approach to addressing the challenges posed by excessive traffic is to conceptualize several types of interaction—such as texts and photographs—as a form of interference or \"detrimental externality.\" In geography, an externality refers to a component of an economic activity that affected other regions who did not expect to be employed in that area. For instance, fog and sea clouds are considered additional externalities that impose costs on communities and the environment.\n\nA market-based approaches to managing externalities was proposed by economist Ronald Coase in his previous project, \"The case of property interference\" (1960). This discussion drew from Coase's earlier dissertation on the Federal Communications Commission (1959), in which he noted that radio frequency interference represents a significant externality that could be mitigated through the restoration of property privileges. By applying empirical observations to air pollution, it would be useful to present proposals that balance the interest of advertisers and sellers while minimizing the adverse consequence of excessive activity.", "y": "gpt", "sample_id": 59}
